"I love this game, probably if not my favorite it's in my top 3 favorite games list. I've played this practically non-stop since I got it. It's so much fun to play! I've also played Norselands and Dead Lands, both of these DLCs are super fun to play! I did try Call of Olympics but I couldn't figure out how to leave the first island so not sure I can recommend that DLC....yet. This is a very chill game but it can get pretty hard the longer you survive. I just wish they had merch cause I'd love a t-shirt or a sticker of some sort.",True,1743708796

"2025 coop and solo review -
This game is fantastic! Really good if you have a non-gamer partner since the mechanics are easy to pick up but the gameplay is rewarding. It was a fun adventure to explore and expand in the different islands and try to defeat the shadows. :)

[h1] [b] The Good [/b] [/h1]

+ Easy controls & mechanics for beginners
+ Mounts and NPCs are fun to unlock (griffin mount is too good)
+ Story doable in one sitting
+ Really engaging when played through Co-op
+ Different DLCs either change the scenarios or add more gameplay mechanics to the base game

[h1] [b] The Bad [/b] [/h1]

- Does get repetitive after the 4th island
- Wish there were more buildings, unit and things to do in the base game

Overall, a coop classic and a nice gem! Hopefully they develop a third installment with more things to do",True,1743556897
"They keep reusing the same idea with every new paid DLC, adding little to no innovation to the gameplay. Each DLC comes with its own set of new bugs, which often stick around until the next re-skin of the game rolls out.",False,1743540336
"I love the Kingdom series and played all games in the series. However, I cannot recommend this game and the only reason is bugs. If you want the Kingdom experience you can play the Kingdom New Lands and you'll get a very good experience. The only new thing that Two Crowns is bringing to the table is split screen. I'm playing with my son and have some fun. But bugs are really frustrating:
- Game is crashing and hanging quite constantly, I usually play 1-1.5 hours sessions and game hangs 2-3 times during that period. The progress is saved daily yet still it's a very frustrating experience
- Sometimes I experience a bug that after expanding the town some buildings do not appear (like armory or catapults). Restarting the game fixes it.
- During the portal attacks archers get in front of the knights and getting killed. Happens all the time, killing the game (to exit without saving) and restating from the start of the day sometimes fixes the problem. But it's a very frustrating issue to lose 12-16 archers and 3-4 knights just because of the buggy archers.

Also, compared to the New Lands the game design is forcing you to speed up, if you are not fast enough on the first isles and get to the last one on the day 60 or even later you have zero chance to survive because you start with nothing meanwhile the enemy attacks with a huge army. It's kinda questionable design decision. I understand that the game saves progress between isles and you have very strong upgrades on the last one but you don't have a time to hire an army and build walls. And without an army all those upgrades are useless.",False,1743522837

"Exellent game. It combines old school gamaes where you have to dicover mechanics by yourself, with a touch of Tower Defense, however instead of a top down view, it adds something many people might call ""Walking Simulator"" or ""Left and Right Simulator"". I dont like classing Tower Defense games and I consider the dev's take on this as excellent fit for my tastes. While playing alone is OK, consider playing with friends where you could lots of fun and time will fly without you even know. Don't be afraid to play on ""cursed"" difficulty as it will provide a challenge, but not make the game unbeatable.

"Beautiful art style, but the lack of balance and warning for brand new enemies can ruin an otherwise perfect run, looking at you greed wolves that jump over squads, and warthogs hiding in bushes. The game needs a mechanic to allow for saving your crown instead of just watching it run away after you are instantly ambushed.

Pt 2. After googling what killed me, I tried again on cursed and completely took over the second island. Now with gems, I thought it would be intended to revisit the first island as it had 0 gems to find but many areas to use them. Well it turns out the first night I'm back, the horde is gigantic against my reset base, causing game over again. How is this game balanced?",False,1742793563

"Very pretty pixel art. Gameplay is extremely simple and casual. I don't think it's possible to die (at least not so far), when you get hit the monsters just steal your coins. This isn't really a city builder or tower defense game at all - you can only build on existing nodes and there aren't many strategic choices to be made. 

Probably not worth full price imo but I got this in a game bundle and it was fun for an hour. Not sure if I'll keep playing.",True,1742670264

"This game is saved by its atmosphere, which is excellent. I would say it's worth buying and playing, but maybe not worth completing. it's cozy first, resource management second.

The campaign starts off strong, and seems to have a lot of potential. Lots of interesting tools are introduced. Unfortunately, the last 75% of the campaign isn't meaningfully different from the first 25%, and by the end, feels more like a trial of patience than anything else - many of the tools I unlocked never really had their chance to shine. I played on the Hard difficulty.

Unfortunately, the difficulty is immensely front-loaded - you will find the greatest challenge on the first 10-15 nights on any island, after which the game becomes trivial if you're playing tactically.

So far the challenges have each started off interesting, but much like the campaign, become an exercise in patience if you make it to night 10. I am writing this review as I afk in my cursed island run, waiting for the 40th day to arrive. 

I just wish the difficulty was a little more finely tuned...",True,1742595442

"Kingdom: Two Crowns has quickly become a beloved staple in our gaming routine, and I can confidently say that it's one of the best co-op experiences my 9-year-old daughter and I have ever had! This beautifully crafted game offers a perfect blend of strategy, exploration, and teamwork, making it ideal for family play.

From the very first moment we launched the game, we were drawn into its charming pixel-art world. The aesthetics are stunning, with vibrant landscapes and mesmerizing animations that create an enchanting atmosphere. The simplicity of the graphics is refreshing, yet the attention to detail keeps us engaged as we explore various kingdoms.

What truly makes Kingdom: Two Crowns special is its cooperative gameplay. My daughter and I love working together to build our kingdom, gather resources, and defend against the ever-encroaching threats. The split-screen feature is fantastic, allowing us to strategize and communicate effectively as we tackle challenges together. It’s a great bonding experience, and we often find ourselves laughing and cheering each other on as we solve puzzles and navigate through the game’s intricacies.

The gameplay mechanics are straightforward yet deeply engaging. We enjoy figuring out new strategies to expand our kingdom, upgrade our defenses, and manage our resources. Each session feels new with different puzzles and challenges, and we often find ourselves brainstorming solutions together. It’s not just a game; it’s a fun, interactive way to develop critical thinking and teamwork skills.

One of the highlights for us is the variety of ways we can approach each level. Whether we decide to focus on building up our defenses or exploring new areas, the freedom to choose our path keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting. It’s rewarding to see our kingdom grow and thrive, and we take pride in our collaborative efforts.",True,1742327589

"Its a charming indie game, but quickly becomes repetitive and boring. I'm not even sure what category this game falls into, its not a tower defense since you can't choose what tower you make. its not a kingdom management because again no choice in what or where you build. You play as a king character that runs along and collects taxes from the citizens. Then you use the money to buy(?) peasants, and then have them join a profession to either make more money or defend against the nightly attacks. There isn't really any strategy involved beyond save up money, and slowly build your forces up until you can take everything out. Most of the time you are running around the 2d pixel world collecting money from the citizens, which can take up to 30 seconds to get across the map with you doing nothing but holding down a single key. Again there really isn't any choice or decisions you make in this game. You are given specific locations to be allowed to build a wall. You can't strategize between how far you build the wall, and the nearby tower. This game overall reminds me of the old flash era games where you defend against relentless waves, but in those you still get to choose which weapons/upgrades to get. Here there isn't really any choice except choosing to go left or right on the map. An annoying thing is you get completely annihilated on one side of the map, your army on the other side will just sit there and do nothing. Eventually they will get attacked from behind, and you lose the game since the npcs can't turn around",False,1742073190

"Kingdom Two Crowns should have been, just as ""New lands"" was, an expansion to the original game concept.
But they broke away from it a lot, and I notice so many issues, like squire-followers sticking their ass out of walls and getting attacked, soldiers do not move up to support a newly built wall in time unless it's withint spitting distance.
Something good they did was that blessings no longer needed to be refilled every day to stay active, sadly it seems this is partially from the idea that an island is no longer Rogue-like in it's existance, but rather a set island that will remain as it is for the whole save. But as you will be able to return to an older island it will have lost some infrastructure since last you were there depending on how long you were gone.",False,1741798765

Simple mechanic, beautiful graphics and magnificent music this is a game you have to play 100/10",True,1741283950
"Pros: 
Game has lovely graphics, animations, and music.
Game play loop is interesting and rewarding (create a thriving town, take out portals where 'greed' monsters come out of every night', take a boat to unknown islands where you can unlock more resources for better upgrades). 

Cons: 
You have to intuit quite a lot of things, or look them up. For example, what does a red moon do? (I think spawns more/harder monsters). Random 'hermit' you pick up? (depends on the hermit, upgrades specific buildings). What about the little man that parades in front of your castle after several upgrades (he's the banker, give him money and he'll keep it in the castle for you)... A glossary in game of these things would be great once you unlock them. 

Once your town is quite large, you spend A LONG time running back and forth between the two sides of your defences!! It is very beautiful, but it'll take you a minute or two to get from one side to the other.",True,1741261483

You play a king or queen who needs to gain coins in the day to fend off creatures at night, progressively getting harder as you upgrade along the way. There is a good amount of content here and plenty of DLC for after.",True,1741117290
"I have very much enjoyed the base game. Recently came back to play it a second time to do a deathless max difficulty run. But for most people, I imagine this will just be a chill experience. It's very easy to load up and play for 10-30 mins if that's your thing. It's also great if you're the type of guy to play for 8 hours straight. 

Personally, I wish there was a bit more challenge beyond the base campaign. There are these challenge islands, which are hit and miss but a good addition overall. I also wish there was an impossible difficulty mode above the current max difficulty. I never felt pushed to fully min-max every mechanic even on max difficulty.",True,1741065740
"After the frustrating experience that was New Lands, I wasn't terribly interested in giving this one a shot. Finally picked up a copy for myself and a friend not too long ago since it was on a good sale.
And am I happy I did!
He had never heard of the series and immediately got addicted to the deceptively simple formula.
And I enjoyed the fact that they have taken my grips from the first two and smoothed it out into a much better experience. Including finally giving more options than than simply dropping gold. With different character and mount abilities to assist with exploration and combat.
Spawning camps across the island and then having the recruits casually walk all the way back is a thing of the past as they immediately run to your base. Making it much more viable to keep recruiting even when they are behind an enemy portal or two.
Speaking of, the overall design just feels faster and more fluid. With a thankfully more pulled back camera. Giving a better sense of your surroundings than the previous games.
Which is good because the pixel graphics are gorgeous! Even if the character models themselves may look to have taken a step back.
However, because of the amount of content locked behind coop, you may want to save this one for playing with a friend. The solo experience here isn't bad, I would just suggest the first game for something more tailored to that experience.

"This game has so much potential to be good but is insanely clunky and frustrating to play. They've been evolving the formula with sequels but never make it more fun to play by removing the frustrating aspects of the design that kill the fun you're having.

"It's a cool game, nice to switch off for a bit.

There are reskins of the game as dlc. but the game mostly plays exactly the same, you're just a samurai instead of a king, you cut bamboo instead of birch trees e.t.c. 

I played the previous game and it's very much the same. That being said, the game clearly is intended to be a minimalist 'cozy' game, and it does that quite well.

The reason i don't recommend is because I think the game is not worth it's asking price on steam for the amount of content given, Devs should look at their game in comparison with other indie games inside the same price point of $15-$20.

"[h1] TL;DR: [/h1] I would say probably should wait until sale (until they actually fix all the stupid bugs)

[h1] Positives [/h1]
[olist]
    [*] Fun gameplay[1]
    [*] Decently balanced[2]
    [*] Multiplayer support is dope
    [*] Variety of choices is nice[3]
    [*] Decent graphics
[/olist]

[h2] Explaination [/h2]
[1] I think that the basic design of the game is pretty much rock solid, it does exactly as it’s advertised being a town-defense game which is quite rare.
[2] It’s surprisingly balanced even for a beginner, obviously if you play on higher difficulties or do the challenge islands you’re up for a challenge but overall I noticed there’s very little intentional unfairness in this game, something I think is a huge plus.
[3] I like that you can customize small parts of the game, the mount you use, the king/queen you are (if you play with deadlands DLC) and the town itself.


[h1] Negatives [/h1]
[olist]
    [*] Bugs… all these stupid bugs[1]
    [*] Soundtrack is… eh? There’s like 5 tracks and while they’re not bad it’s more of the same
    [*] Badly designed upgrades[2]
    [*] Very stale/loopy gameplay elements[3]
    [*] Certain gameplay design decision is awful[4]
    [*] Lacking depth[5]
[/olist]
[h2] Explaination [/h2]
[1] This is the game’s biggest weak point, it’s the amount of bugs the game has, some bugs are funny such as being able to buy a lighthouse despite not clearing the portal monster; while most are annoying to downright game breaking such as:
[list]
    [*] The ghost coins bug, which effectively softlocks your progress (you cannot spend your ghost coins, can’t get rid of them and if you pick up a coin, it just disappears); only thing that works is restarting the campaign/map.
    [*] You can’t recruit soldiers for some reason (have to restart the game)
    [*] In Deadlands DLC your king/queen can decide to stop using their ability until you restart the game
    [*] Greedlings can 1 shot your fully upgrade soldier or bowman because it jumped just right
[/list]
There’s probably more than this, especially since the latest DLC seems to be rife with bugs.

[2] Overall, I think the upgrades you can get are fine in this game, but some are newbie traps, such as the bakery, (I would even argue the guards tower) or a “waste” such as the blowhorn upgrade.
Yes technically, they serve a purpose, but that purpose is so specific or minor that it’s just not worth the hassle or the upgrade.
Especially, the bakery is a complete slap in the face, as you’re sacrificing the crucial tower spot for this building which… makes you attract vagrants around the map, this would’ve been fine if:
[olist]
    [*] You could combine the bakery with the tower
    [*] It gave you something more than just the ability to attract vagrants
[/olist]
[3] This isn’t a huge negative, but it can get quite tiring to have to do the exact same strategy/build over and over again: build the base, build the ship, etc.
The format then for attack is always the same:
Speedrun to island 5, then attack it and destroy the cave first, then rinse and repeat for islands 4, 3, 2, and finally 1.
Then you can, with no resistance whatsoever, destroy the portal monsters.
I’m not against this strategy necessarily, the problem is lack of reward/point of doing it any different way.
In fact, doing it any other way just makes the game harder.
[4] This really irks me, these ideas really should’ve been playtested more because they can ruin the experience, such as:
[list]
    [*] Where the spearmen/swordman upgrade will appear (the fact that only 1 spearman base can spawn makes you have to wait on expanding until you know exactly the map layout)
    [*] The fact that you can only send out soldiers with bowman for attacks, that they always get ‘killed’ because of the greedling 1-shot bug, making you have to spam the stupid recruit or sacrifice multiple towers to get more soldiers
    [*] You can’t reverse/change decisions you’ve made, whether that be NOT cutting down that tree, NOT building that tower/wall, or “connecting” the teleporters wrongly
    [*] There’s no real reward in killing the portal monster beyond access to the lighthouse, which is such a minor bonus; in fact, you’re a fool if you attack the portal monster first, as it just makes the subsequent attempts at the greedling cave much harder.
[/list]
There’s probably more than this, but this is my main gripe with the game.
[5]The gameplay is quite simple, but I really wish there was more depth to this game, that the DLC added more personality to the towns and how they function differently, they sort of do this in the Norseland DLC but even then it’s not enough to change the core dynamic, mostly just unit swap.
 

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
I’m torn on this game, the biggest 2 downsides to the game is it’s bugs and overlooked/bad game design which doesn’t ruin the game but certainly sours the mood, I do still think it’s a really good game and as such I think it can be a nice 100 hour game investment (excluding multiplayer), as such I think it’s worth recommending the game but only when it’s on sale as it just doesn’t justify the cost with the bugs present.",True,1740726175

"A video of this review is available here https://youtu.be/0jDMkqsQTVM

Kingdom, the little game that could, 'now' with Two Crowns!!
Well I say 'now', the games been out for ages, there's a new Greek flavoured dlc I wanted to cover and it felt weird doing that without doing this first.
Anywho, here goes.....
Do you like the idea of riding left to right through Classic kingdom, fantasy ancient Greece, feudal Japan or a um, a sort of vaguely horror themed world,, 
But now with a friend?!! AND assuming you both bought the dlc!! 
Then this might be the kingdom game for you, and a friend!! 
For the newbies.... 
Kingdoms gameplay loop essentially revolves around throwing money at the working class until they are willing to blindly die for you, (is that a satire?). 
Exploiting their labour to build up your town and then resisting waves of baddies that attack by night - while expanding your kingdom to eventually defeat the evil from each island. 
You travel between islands by absolutely smashing your ships into the next island like a Tesla product with broken brakes and then building up a new town on the next island to repeat the cycle.  
All accompanied by delightful pixel art graphics and a surprisingly emotive soundtrack. 
Aesthetically, the designers for the kingdom games evidently know what they're doing. 

I'm a fairly committed fan of the Kingdom games, I've completed most of them solo, they sorta cant be beat for the almost meditative feel they elicit. 
The feeling of the Kingdom franchise remains intact in Two Crowns even when arguing about who stole whose gold from whose farms. 
This was always going to be a positive review, Kingdom always worked as a game but the most tedious part of the franchise was always the endless need to trot left and right, 
across a fairly large map, 
repeatedly, 
with your mount frequently suffering from bouts of emphysema, ESPECIALLY at crucial moments when it would be more ideal if your mount hadn't stopped for a rest while you were being perused by all of the horrors of the night!!   

Once you add a buddy though, this problem is solved, or more accurately halved. 
So for instance your Yanky buddy could emulate America and take care of pushing far to far right, while your European buddy works out things moderately on the left- halving the walking burden of the whole game. 
One of the things I most enjoy about two crowns is the countless opportunities to screw each other over by stealing magic items mounts and limitless gold from one another's farms, this probably says more about me than the game though so maybe you will teamwork differently. 

With the simple controls and various difficulty levels and the wide range of environments in which to play the game, I think Kingdom: Two Crowns makes a great game to play with practically anyone, even if they don't usually game. 
From younger family members to more competitive completionist types who wish to unlock all the achievements and solve all of the hidden puzzles. 
Kingdom offers a co-op town management strategy like experience perfect to introduce a gamer to this type of genre or else a relaxing interpretation of the game type for a couple of experienced players. 
So yeah. if you haven't yet. check out Two Crowns if you know literally anyone. which is nearly everyone!!

"I really wanted to like this game, it has some of the most clever and immersive uses of a very simple mechanic I've ever seen and sells it's setting so well. Little details fill every aspect of the game, and it's genuinely fascinating how well it accomplishes forcing you to behave like a true King. 

Two things kill it. 

1. Character select is full of microtransaction characters that open an ad to buy them when you investigate. The in game shop is intrusive and annoying in general. 

2. The game doesn't tell you anything, and all your choices are permanent. Its a rogue-like, but once your character visits an island, what you do or build there is there forever unless you reset your save. This is frustrating because there is very little information provided about almost anything. Most of your first interactions with a mechanic will be you experimenting, but when you accidentally turn your critical defensive tower into a bakery, or set a portal 2 feet away from its origins because you were just testing what it did, that's permanent now. 

I wouldn't recommend this unless it's on sale, the fact that it demands you watch tutorials or wiki articles flies in the face of it's aesthetic and gameplay loop so bad that it becomes frustrating instead of fun.

"Hace unos años steam regalo casualmente el Classic (el primer juego cuando ni habian salido las secuelas) y vaya sorpresa me di con lo bello, adictivo y entretenido que es Kingdom. Describiendolo es un 2D Pixel-Styled de estrategia y manejo de recursos (en este caso pones a chambear aldeanos asignandoles entre defender la aldea o ser mano de obra generando dinero) con el fin de sobrevivir y exterminar a lo que puedo considerar hordas de zombies antes de que ellos te exterminen primero. La dificultad es inevitable en este juego basicamente obligandote a familiarizarte con cada mecanica para sacarle el provecho necesario, son de esos juegos que debes ser diligente con las mecanicas para triunfar. 

A todo esto mi unico problema es [b]LA INTELIGENCIA[/b] o mejor dicho la falta de ella en los aldeanos, Kingdom a ser un juego que ha ido mejorando y expandiendose tras cada entrega lo proximo en mejorar deberia ser una mejor respuesta de los aldeanos al peligro o un mejor manejo para ellos. Cosas como que los obreros consideren mas importante cortar un arbol antes que su propia vida o, que al construir una nueva pared medianamente lejos los arqueros tomaran sus posiciones ya al caer la noche o cuando el greed la este atacando, son pequeñas cosas que ademas de promover frutracion puede costarte gran parte de la aldea o hasta de la partida.

Sin mas nada que decir, todo lo demas es buenisimo, la musica relajante, el Pixelart detallado y bonito, la experiencia coop y buena cantidad de contenido. Un buen ejemplo de la expresion [b]“Hacer más con menos”[/b].[h1]Simplemente una joya oculta 7/10[/h1]",True,1740357399

"I enjoyed Kingdom: Classic, back before it was called that, and also enjoyed Two Crowns. It has hectic moments but overall it's a bit on the slower side if you track how much time you spend just running between locations. With the slightly mysterious vibe it lends itself well to a somewhat more chill/casual experience. On the flipside I think this approach, where a lot of the fun comes from discovering how the game plays for the first time, there's somewhat reduced replay value past the first couple of games or so. What was once ""chill"" may become ""tedious"" or ""repetitive"" (though even if that happens, it doesn't lessen your enjoyment for those first couple of playthroughs!).

My biggest gripe with Kingdom: Two Crowns is that, unless you're a hardcore Kingdom fan, 80% of the game is the same between Kingdom: Two Crowns, Kingdom: New Lands, and Kingdom: Classic. Two Crowns is the ""definitive"" experience of the three but it's hard to say it's different enough to have justified it as a new standalone game compared to New Lands; it's closer to an expansion pack.

Given that Kingdom: Classic has been made free to play, perhaps check that out and use it as a demo for the core gameplay of Two Crowns if you've never played these games before, then grab Two Crowns if you enjoy your time with Classic and want more of that and/or a more fleshed out version of (basically) the same core game.",True,1740152443

"This is the kind of game you just keep coming back to. The challenge levels are fun, and while progression is pretty repetitive, it doesn't feel like you're grinding out the same days over and over (unless you get stuck waiting for spring on an island that's in perpetual winter, oops! :P )

The sounds are well chosen, the music is the kind of track you could listen to for hours, the gameplay is smooth, the multiplayer is mostly good (a few issues with disconnects in the newest DLC, but devs are actively working on it -public test branch seems to be working- at the time of this review)...  My only complaint is that there aren't more of them, but this is the kind of game where I can convince a friend to buy the base game and drag them along through my DLC so I've gotten a fair amount of replayability from getting new friends to play with me.

This is definitely one of my all-time favourite games, and I just keep coming back to it. I have it and 80s both on mobile and have beaten them there, too!

"I've played these games since the first kingdom came out, and fell in love with the series. Kingdom Two Crowns is an amazing addition to the collection- but it stops there. I played the Greek DLC for about two days straight with my partner, and we were left with only malice and regret at the end. This game was full of holes, bugs, and general annoyances through and through. Many were manageable, simply requiring a reboot. From the greed flying upwards, or getting stuck in the portal locking the moon in place (and freezing time, along with countless other bugs), we still played on. It would've been a fun, tolerable experience until the final island. ***(SPOILERS)*** (although you shouldn't buy this anyways) The giant serpent completely broke the game. We received zero waves of nightly attacks, except for the wave we got when arriving (and when we returned), the snake bugged out constantly, and spoiled the entire experience. I bought this DLC as soon as it came out, and when it was a buggy mess, i decided to give it some time. Coming back MONTHS later and seeing NOTHING fixed was extremely disheartening and disappointing. Even during the final scene, with the Trojan horse, the game was buggy, having the horse refuse to move or advance at all. All in all, the game had plenty of fun and cool concepts, but terrible execution. I will NEVER recommend this DLC unless serious changes are made.",False,1738920811

The musics are lovely, but then the SFX are Windows95 tier so... yeah.
I'd say you could just play Kingdom: Classic which is free to play, and if you REALLY love it, OR if you want to play with your friends (the split screen co-op is lovely) then go for Two Crowns.

Despite its simplicity, I find it to be rather satisfying and addicting: slowly getting more people, increasing the amount of money you make, expanding your kingdom closer and closer to the greed. It's a rather fun loop. I've played the first two islands over and over again many times, but I usually die by the third island. While it is the case that you can just have a new monarch when you lose your crown, I sort of just lose motivation to keep playing after losing my crown, not sure why.

"Kingdom TC gets a mid rating ~6/10 despite its charm and unique feel because of its frustrating game-ending jank/bugs, unreliable unit responsiveness/pathing, and the ultimate lack of depth this game has. I have played this game a lot despite its shallow nature because it scratches a unique itch no other game has for me yet. I just wish it was better. I've played this mostly solo, but did have time in CO-OP, which was quite fun.
I will say that what makes this game worthy of love is the visual design, sound design, and readability of what's on the screen (for the most part) despite having so many overlapping units and background layers. Even with 100+ mixed units you can still pick out when there's builders, archers, knights, etc in that jumbled mess of pixels. It's not perfect, but it does a great job considering the limitations in 2D side-scrolling.

Time spent in this game will be mostly learning what the units do, how to interact with them, how they behave, how to not die constantly, and all of this with very simple (and sometimes annoying) 'guidance' that tells you nothing about what the guidance is trying to help you achieve.

The gameplay involves managing your units, coin, and kingdom. Hire vagrants, buy tools for the hired vagrants to use, then spend coin on upgrades to your kingdom or more tools. You have to learn how the wave timing works, when to start jobs outside the safety of your walls, and what needs to be prioritized for upgrading or else you're going to suffer a very frustrating kingdom wipe. 

Even on EASY mode, the game is very easy to lose after a few in-game weeks (a few IRL hours) due to scaling enemy waves and Blood Moons that bring more dangerous waves. There are 5 difficulty settings from Peaceful to Cursed for those who like specific degrees of challenge.

As a side note: The game seems to have been passed around between coders, so although devs still reply on steam there's jank/bugs that still persist. (DLC were released extremely buggy, only recently fixed).",False,1738225361

"This is one of those games that looks great in the trailers, but barely scratches the surface in everything it's trying to be.

The economy system is okay...
As you kill enemies, you fill up a bag with the coins they drop. However, there is a limit to how many coins you can carry, and getting hit will cause you to drop them.

The building system sucks.
The game does a really good job at gatekeeping you just below the difficulty curve, so it never actually feels like you're winning. The upgrades for buildings are VERY lacking and the upgrade system is not intuitive at all. Once you upgrade a building, it's very questionable what it actually upgraded. Did the building get better, or was the upgrade just for progress?

The game tries to be a tower defense, but it sucks at that too.
The combat can be brutal. The entire game is spent struggling to get enough resources so you can fund your troops to protect you. The moment you realize your troops are not enough, a good chunk (if not ALL) of your progress will be wiped away. The upgrades for your defensive buildings are not nearly enough to hold off the hordes, and for the ridiculous amount of effort for getting the resources required for upgrading makes each of the upgrades feel next to useless when they get chewed thru by the hordes. Your troops are super squishy so you need a ton of them to feel safe, and with that comes more grinding for food. Just constantly starving for resources.

The DLC SUPER sucks.
All of the DLC is just a cash grab. They all feel like reskins of the base game, and sold to you with the idea that you're getting something new. There's very minor differences between all of them like small abilities that really make no impact to the game whatsoever.

Over all, if you're curious about this game, buy it when it's on sale for $10 or less. This game is 70% artwork and atmosphere, and only 30% good gameplay. You'll more than likely be bored of it after a day or two",False,1737833833

And if you host, make sure the person you are playing with as host has good wifi/ethernet because your friend will get kicked if that is not the case. Host has a lot of advantage in wifi/ethernet terms.

Also, check the wiki. You don't need it necessarily, but it is very useful if you don't want/can't figure a certain thing out. Can be a bit confusing since all of the kingdom games are hosted in one wiki.

Squires/Knights will no longer try to get closer to the portal after being knocked back a bit causing the archers to be out of range of the portal and any squires/knights you brought from a previous island will sometimes randomly run off to the left (sometimes not even stopping for portals) to their death for no reason.

"The game puts you in the role of a king who’s pretty much at the mercy of his own troops’ terrible AI. My friend and I really tried to get into it, but honestly, it felt more like a chore than anything fun. It was like babysitting a bunch of annoying little kids.

The big problem is that everything is handled by AI. You can’t do much on your own; your troops give you money, and you just pick what to upgrade. The idea is cool, but the AI is a mess. Troops sometimes do stupid things, like getting stuck in random spots or even running headfirst into the enemy and dying, which leaves you feeling completely helpless. You can tell them to ""attack"" and watch the chaos unfold, but they might turn their back on the enemy or charge straight in and waste your precious coins (the currency in the game).

The rogue-like aspect of the game is interesting because after you die, the things you have built will slowly start to be destroyed.",True,1736846116
"Same game as the first one just with new skins, instead of medieval you can play a shogun theme or fantasy theme, but the game play is the same. fun for like 3 hours and then it's just the same game loop over and over, it gets old real fast. progressing in this game is a loop it's not linear so once you've experienced the first island and escaped you've done everything there is to do in the game.

It's not bad, it's just not enough new content to justify this being a sequel. It would've been more appropriate to have added this as an update or dlc to kingdom new lands or just held onto it while they added more content and tweaked the game play loop for the sequel so it actually feels like a sequel.

TLDR: if you own kingdom new lands, don't buy this it's more or less the same game. If you don't own any kingdom games then do buy this, you get an added layer of customization to choose your kingdoms theme and slight building/upgrade differences that isn't in new lands.",False,1736826808

"Um milhão de vezes mais fácil que o clássico, mas muito divertido. As características e interações novas dessa versão são muito bacanas, o que somado ao fato de (assim como no clássico) o jogo não te explicar o que cada coisa faz torna a experiência de jogar cheia de descobertas.

"A great hero shooter with some fresh ideas for the genre, a beautiful art style, and awesome hero design.

The maps could be a bit more navigable, but that's a minor quibble.

Monetization is cosmetics only. There's a more than fair season pass (10$, unlocks a unique skin immediately and then several more as you play), although the individual skins in the shop are quite pricey ($16 to $28 per skin, some of which are underwhelming.)

"If this game were in early access at this stage, I’d call it a promising masterpiece and wholeheartedly recommend it. However, since it’s not, I can’t do so with full confidence.

Perhaps if the developers had focused on adding more diversity in buildings, units, and placement options - rather than prioritizing race or skin color diversity - it might have felt more complete and enjoyable. When your Norse kingdom feels like it’s been pulled straight out of a typical Netflix series, it can really break the immersion.

The endgame is completely missing, there is 0 description of things, and you can not eres buildings if you accidentally build them the wrong way. Replayability is also limited, as the island order is always the same in every playthrough.

So, why recommend it? Because the core concept is brilliant, and despite its shortcomings, playing on split-screen is still genuinely fun.",True,1736432373
"All this game boils down to is going left, going right and dropping coins/gems to watch people scurry about building, fighting, equipping or what have you. Sometimes you may have an attack or similar, depending on what game mode you're in, but often you don't.

This is one of my favorite games. I love it. However, I cannot currently recommend it.

Ever since the Norselands expansion, each expansion worsened the networking issues that we are experiencing.
It got to a point where the game is simply not fun anymore. This is the first negative review I write, in the hopes that the developers will put some priority on fixing this. I know that they are struggling to reproduce this issue, but it's so easy to reproduce, even locally. Let packets jitter, drop some others, even at simulated packet loss rates of 1%, the game drops the session.

"Another game that I mainly play with my nephew, but this is one of my favorites. While the fact you can only move left and right at first seems to make the game feel trivial, as you get deep into the building and survival aspects, you start to see where the depth and fun in this game comes from as you explore new lands and dangers, build your empire, and find and recruit new people to come to your kingdom, all while trying to keep the dangers subsided. I can't speak for the singleplayer, but I feel it is probably a little tougher than multiplayer since your teammate can restore your crown if you lose it.

"So for context, I wholly enjoyed Kingdom: Classic many years ago. However I ended up getting frustrated and took a 6 year break. Fast forward to Fall 2024 when I saw on my Steam page that there was a new expansion to Kingdom: Two Crowns and they were having a sale for it. The new expansion got me pretty excited and I no-lifed Call of Olympus without any prior experience (except for 20 hours of Classic). It was challenging just kind of barreling into with no idea what I was doing except for the helpful ghost; but for me that's what made it really fun. So Call of Olympus is fantastic; and currently I'm working my way through the other campaigns. At almost 140 hours I've completed all of them except for, ironically, the original European campaign.

All of this to say that I'm hooked. The way the game is played itches the ADHD; there's always something you can be doing (upgrading, hiring new hoplites, gathering money, etc.) and there's almost never a lull in the gameplay progression. I have easily sunk 8-10 hours in a day just playing one campaign because it sucks me in so easily. The pixel graphics are gorgeous and the music is atmospheric and lovely; I particularly love Call of Olympus' soundtrack. I also love the co-op ability, my sibling and I have played together and it's really enjoyable.

If you're on the fence about it, I'd be the nudge to just go for it. The community is knowledgeable and the wiki is frequently updated. It's a fun game with interesting mechanics, beautiful esthetics, and really great replay value.",True,1736111278

There is no warning or anything, it just happens and you have to sit there doing basically nothing for like an hour until it goes away. Their version of more difficult is the same thing but you sit there for 3x as long just waiting for money. Its like the previous games but worse in every way imaginable.",False,1736052210
"The tutorial is ass. It's trial and error, but the game progresses like molasses so each trial takes too much time. There's stamina on your character, yet most of the game is traversing your 2D kingdom back and forth, so you just sit there watching your character inch forward every few seconds. 

There's also game breaking bugs. The islands generate randomly, and sometimes you can get hard-blocked from progressing on the second island due to how it generates. Get the game on sale or don't get it at all.",False,1736048816

Also, Perhaps this was always the developer's intent, I'm uncertain. But forcing players to leave island 1 to get the stone mine secured is rather brutal.

"Kingdom is one of my all time favorite games since I was little. I remember watching Youtube videos of playthroughs of Kingdom Classic and thinking that I can't wait to buy this game for myself once I'm older. From kingdom Classic to Kingdom: Two Crowns I can only say that this game improves so much and so beautifully with each DLC that you can just roam around your island and listen to the music and watch your kingdom expand and you'd still have a great time playing it. 
Truly exceptional game, the details, the music, the islands, everything is worth buying this game. I also want to add that its also full of challenges that put you through a lot of thinking, to build or not that wall, to destroy a portal or not, its truly a strategic game that requires time and critical thinking. 
Personally I cannot add anything negative about kingdom, I'm not saying the game is perfect but from my experience playing it is serves exactly what you'd expect from a strategy game.

"Rarely does a game so simple leave such a profound impact. With its 2D layout, stunning pixel art graphics and one simple mechanic - dropping gold coins - Kingdom: Two Crowns proves that sometimes, less is more.

While the Kingdom series began with Kingdom: Classic back in 2015, Kingdom: Two Crowns is the pinnacle of refinement that continues to build various picturesque worlds while both elevating existing content, and creating new, compelling mechanics.

You are a monarch - a figure of power sat atop your trusty steed that travels the lush 2D scape in search of vagrants you can hire to do your bidding. Whether you need builders, archers, spearmen or farmers, there’s always something that needs attending to.
Upgrading your base costs gold. Upgrading your walls costs gold. Expanding your territory, chopping down trees, and building archer towers costs gold. Weightless is the crown that bears total financial freedom! That is, until you manage it all wrong. Which will happen two, five, ten times over. The view of your empty coin purse in the top right of your screen will imbue your headpiece once again with weight enough to crush both you and your valiant stallion.

The beauty of Kingdom lies in its casual, chilled, yet steep learning curve. One minute you’re frolicking through the woods, bounding amongst the stags whilst admiring the beautiful waterfalls, and the next, you return to find your kingdom felled - eradicated by the game’s main enemy: the Greed.
Arriving at nightfall, these little terrors arrive in groups that scale with time. They’re very easy to overlook at the start of your adventures, but they have a tendency to surprise you with their numbers and completely overwhelm and therefore decimate your forces. However, it’s not destruction they’re after - it’s your crown.

This is where it gets interesting. Because of the Greed’s obsession with monetary value, [i] your health is your gold. [/i] Each time you’re hit by these devious beings, you lose a coin. Once your bag is empty, your crown will topple, and it's up to you to retrieve it, or risk losing your empire almost entirely.
Success lies in preparation: keep archers well-stocked, walls fortified, and carefully expand your territory as time passes. A well-placed archer tower or extra spearman can turn the tide during nighttime assaults.

Kingdom is a game that has accompanied me through countless evenings - its simple mechanics providing a canvas for strategy, creativity, and reflection. In an era of overcomplicated systems, it’s a gentle reminder of gaming’s roots and the joys of building, even when the Greed takes it all away.",True,1734948304

"I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND YOU PLAY THIS GAME SOLO, I can't fathom moving around so much. I got it on sale for 5$ and I played it with a friend.

I think the game has potential, but it is just way too repetitive, once you clear an island's cave, you can say you finished the game, unless you want to do it 5 times in a row.

The art style is beautiful, cozy and hope you will like it, because you will stare at it for hours as you move around and hear your horse barely breathing from getting tired.

Mechanics are a bit obscure, it is fun at first, but then you don't understand why some stuff happens and it leaves you wondering. Many things are not clear, sometimes, portals will just connect to each other and there is no way to know that, sometimes, people get stuck.

Waves are easy - until they are not and you are not prepared for it at all (floaters are dumb). The fact that you die is not a setback, as it makes the game easier, resetting the day counts, which resets waves but keeps most of your population/buildings.

Griffon is overtuned - or rather, every other mount is bad and pales when compared to it. The Griffon will make your mobility godly, you will not want another mount, it nearly never gets tired, has defensive utility, and instantly restores its stamina no matter where you are.

It is a decent game and if I could, I would give it a mixed review, but since I cannot recommend it fully, it gets a negative from me.",False,1734520663

This has to be one of my favorite games of all time. It's a very simple micro-strategy game, you play as a monarch trying to raise up your kingdom while also trying to defend against the Greed, to one day eradicate them. Two Crowns is special due to being able to continue a legacy reign (you lose some progress but your heir takes over if you die) and being able to travel to multiple islands. Not even to mention the fact the game has an amazing two-player option (my favorite way to play, a buddy always helps!). It's incredibly easy to pick up or teach to others and for the most part, is quite fun and relaxing to play. However, later in the game, the difficulty spikes, but it's incredibly fun when the battles become tough and you're fighting with everything you've got. Two Crowns also has challenge modes which are a fun way to add complexity to more seasoned Kingdom players. Along with some DLC packs, some only cosmetic changes and some are fully new campaigns to the game that adjust the mechanics. I especially loved the Norse Lands and Shogun DLC which always feel like nice ways to freshen up the game.",True,1734317826

"[h2]Such a great and classy 2D multigenre game[/h2]

I fell in love with this game, because it literally contains 3 different genres in one: tower defence, city building and open-world adventure. This cocktail makes me addicted because of the constant desire to discover what surrounds my base. Though the more you play the harder it becomes to hold a defence. That's exactly what motivates me to progress faster to find new resources to build stronger walls, new units etc.
Here you get no explanation more than how to build walls, towers and how to upgrade the base and after this short tutorial you must find out about everything that new mounts do or what hermits can build.

However after completing the main campaign there are plenty of DLCs available. My favourite are with vikings and with Greece because you can personally stand up for yourself with different artifacts. The Dead Lands are my least favourite but have a depressive vibe with a murderous music and appearance of local people which suffer like never before, but in the end clearing all levels has made me a bit happier and left me with a feeling of a bright future for this deceased world. Instead of it the first two expansions that were mentioned are more positive and made me dive into the local atmosphere of vikings or greek mythology by adding unique aggressive units to make player play activer than before or by adding bosses which are pouring in local prophecy perfectly. Overall the core gameplay is the same but each one has an exclusive highlight or a thing that will stay in your memory.

The graphics and the soundtrack are incredible. As I said every story has their own banger moments and music is a part of it. Nevertheless the whole design is remarkable and unique. Music part helps to feel these worlds better and it's just good to listen to them in a free time.

It's worth playing, otherwise I wouldn't have played it for 100 hours if it wasn't that great.",True,1734117038
"TLDR:
Get it on Sale, and look up information prior. Unless you have better amount of patience than me and a grind mindset on each reset, don't get this game.  

I liked the game in the first 10 hours or so only because it was still Fresh and the mechanics were pretty fun. There's a lot of trial and error since there is not much tutorial on what is what. This is fine BUT the replay ability takes SO FCKING LONG. I would've liked a fast forward button. The amount of time it takes you to get to where you would like to start again is annoying. I don't want to have to unlock every mount/shrine again just because I died without any knowledge of an event. For example, dying because I didn't escape the cave fast enough. Before that I restarted the save 5 times because I didn't know you need to bring a long coins. Prior to this (which caused me to quit the game) I was already frustrated with each ""loss"".

"Hello fellow gamers.

A friend recommended this game to me - he is more into these sort of alternative, non blockbuster games. At least thats what I would call this one. Was actually quite pessimistic about it, what with its basic graphics and pretty basic gameplay. I was very wrong. I love this game. I actually bought the previous ones and the DLCs to the current one. This review will consist of three points: Atmosphere, Gameplay, and Retrospect - because I also intend to refer to the previous games on which this is based.

Atmosphere. Game feels retro - basic graphics, sometimes basic 8-bit-like. If I understand correctly, that was the intention, and was achieved perfectly. Does it function well, within its capacity? Yes. Although the graphics are intentionally basic, but the world that is painted is beautiful, there are trees, birds, running water - all that they portray is understandable exactly as what is intended. There are some light play, and, especially at night, that becomes amazing to observe. Actually what surprised me was the requirements for the game. Quite high for what doesn't look so demanding. But, then again, I am no graphics designer. The soundtrack gets better and better - depending on the background of the DLC or game play circumstances, the music adapts. Spoilers ahead so, i dont know, ignore this or whatever. If the campaign is based on Greek myths or Viking, the music will differ to match the period, making the experience much more immersive. Furthermore, naturally, the music will adapt to in-game circumstances, without getting into spoiler-ridden detail, if there is a tension-causing event in game, the music will reflect that, which is exactly what good audio-management should do. And some of those soundtracks are... something you could listen to well after you have finished playing the game. They are just that good.

Gameplay. The controls are very simple. You can go left or right with the respective keys, sprint (there is a comprehensive, invisible stamina system) and spend in game currency coins to interact with the environment. Well and then there are some small additional things which I won't mention for spoiler-related reasons. But they are amazing - try the game, you will see. So now for the full picture - you play the role of a monarch who interacts with the world through spending coins. That's all for your direct control - everything else is done outside of it. Npcs do what they are intended themselves, and you, as the game progresses, learn what impacts them to act one way or another. They are quite reactive to different events that happen in game. However, they are also shortsighted and not omniscient - you need to actually forsee potential risks and account for them. But indirectly. And, I think, thats where the true genius of this game lies - it teaches you, that even if you are the big boss - the monarch - you don't control the laws of nature, and must adapt to them. There are tutorials explaining the very basic concepts of the game, but you are actually left to figure things out quite early. Nothing wrong with that, given that the gameplay is simple and quite understandable. The only thing required of you, as the player, is observation, as everything becomes clear when using that particular intellectual muscle. Duration of gameplay is not long. The 40 hours that I played includes the base game, one of the DLCs completely and half of another DLC. That is another good feature - this is a basic game, you cannot take complex actions, and so making it longer, would not be a good idea as that would just be boring. There is some grinding, but the amount is just right, to make you appreciate your achievements, which, some of them, do take quite some effort.

Retrospect. What I mean to discuss here is this game, in relation to previous releases. Now you may ask - why would you discuss other games when reviewing this one? Simply because this game is a clearly upgraded version of its predecessors both in terms of content and in terms of gameplay quality. In the current game, You almost always have options to get out of bad circumstances which the game threw at you, or ones that you, usually through carelessness have placed yourself. In the previous releases that was not the case - and you were not informed that it won't be the case, so you had no way of knowing that if you don't get certain things right and in time, you are set for some really bad times. Thats one of the few circumstances which, even if left in the game, but given tutorials, would actually be improved. So this relates to Kingdom 2 crowns in that sense, that this is not an issue in it. Which is good. Overall, it is an absolute upgrade from teh previous editions, both content and gameplay-wise.

In summary, this game, along with its DLC's, is awesome. I have played with a friend, which makes it a nice relaxing and interactive experience where we do need to cooperate and support each other. I have tried playing the previous games single player for my own relaxation/meditation purposes but came to a realization that Kingdom Two Crowns is better for that. This game manages both to gently intellectually stimulate and to visually/audibly please. Cannot ask for more and would recommend everyone to try.",True,1733755224

"This is what the second Kingdom game should have been. Two Crowns is an all around massive upgrade from the previous two iterations. The game play is still the same as it was before, simple and easy to understand, but there are many more things added to this one that really enhanced the experience. There are even more new mounts with their own abilities, the are new units to use while old units got  a massive AI upgrade in the form of removed suicidal tendencies, the new buildings really let you change how you play a map, and best of all is that you dont lose all of your progress when dying. Overall there were tons of huge improvements to Kingdom Two Crowns and so far it is the best of the series and totally worth the buy. I had a blast playing through this one.",True,1733693514
"This game is not worth your time, let alone your money. I wouldn't recommend playing this game even for free.

Don't be fooled by the excellent art and animations, this game is about torturously ferrying coins around. It's like Desert Bus if it was poorly disguised as a tower defense game.

For a game that is entirely about moving coins from the left side of your screen four screens to the right and then back, they made the fascinating design choice of having horses full gallop at two miles an hour, and to give all the mounts asthma so they struggle to run 300 feet without needing to stop and catch their breath.

Oh yeah, and there's a *pathetic* carry limit for coins, just so that you get to keep making trips for as long as possible. Mind you, you still *pick up* coins, they are just immediately trashed.

Progression is primarily characterized by the increasing frequency and length of trips.

Every gameplay and ui element feels like it was tuned to slightly annoy you. In no particular order:
- Building a tier 5 wall requires building a tier 1 wall. Then waiting for it to be built. Then tier 2. Then wait. Then tier 3. Then wait. Then tier 4. Then wait. Then tier 5. Then wait.
- The above takes enough gold that it can't be done in one sitting. You have to trudge back across your kingdom to beg each of your citizens for more gold.
- Every time you upgrade the wall, it destroys the previous wall. This leaves you defenseless and evaporates any buildings that were relying on it, every single time you do this.
- Half the screen is water, which does nothing but distract you with a too-bright reflective surface effect
- Just like the rest of the game, spending coins is slow, and the length of time you are forced to stand there for *scales linearly with the cost of the building* while it plays four ascending octaves of coin-adding noises.
- Despite sitting on the slowest horse alive, everyone else is somehow *even slower*.
- You can't control your units and four archers will miss a single enemy a dozen times because the enemy keeps bouncing off your walls at the same rhythm that they fire
- Some portals let you choose their destination. Others blink you instantly to another one. There is no visual difference between the two, and there is no indication of where they'll send you.
- Winter exists only to slow down progression and force you to trudge even further to ferry income around. Also, it lasts **two real-time hours**.",False,1733692403

  Too often I found myself exhausted by the gameplay, which is so simple that it’s impressive the devs managed to get so many bugs crammed into it. Singleplayer is janky, but multiplayer is buggy to the point of frustration. 

  Friend spent gems only for them to disappear into the void, never to be recovered again. This would not be a problem if there was a save file system, but you can only have one save slot which is automatically overwritten every day.

"This could be a very good game ... but some design decisions are either incredibly stupid or deliberately cruel and designed to waste your time and rub your failures in ...

- there are INSANE difficulty spikes (you can get hit with a random winter after spring, blood moon, boar spawning just outside your wall, shrubs spawning FAR FAR away and things you absolutely require to survive not spawning for unknown reasons) ... and you're cooked even on easy.

- RNG can be seriously unfair and the biggest obstacle in the game (you need that farm to spawn as it should because you're in a pinch with money and you won't survive without it ... guess what, it sometimes won't spawn and you're cooked)

- the game tells you NOTHING, and I like that, if not for the fact that it's VERY (and probably deliberately) unbalanced even on easy

- NO SAVE SYSTEM, just sometimes randomly triggered auto-save

- But the biggest and most messed up decision, is what happens when you die! This is either incredibly stupid (which I doubt) or deliberately cruel ...

You start as a new monarch, but you NEED TO TRAVEL TO ALL OF THE ISLANDS, AGAIN! ... AND UNLOCK ALL UPGRADES (you definitely need to survive the last island!) AGAIN!, WHICH TAKES OVER AN HOUR! ... YES, YOU HEARD IT RIGHT, TO RESPAWN AND TRY AGAIN YOU NEED TO INVEST OVER AND HOUR OF TEDIOUS GAMEPLAY! YOU NEED TO UNLOCK ALL MOUNTS AGAIN, ALL HERMITS, ALL STATUES, JUST TO RESTART WHERE YOU WERE DEFEATED! ... insane is putting it mildly. Great game idea ruined by cruelty or insanity of it's creator it seems. Sorry, but this is for people who have LOADS of time to waste in their lives.

And it's frustrating (as you can tell), because IF this game had a NORMAL save system. And would just allow you to take over the kingdom as a new ruler as it should be when you are defeated I would gloss over the other issues and gave it a solid 9/10 ... but as it was designed it's a 0/10 stay the hell away from it. Shame! So much greatness just to ruin it with cruelty and craving to waste people's time.",False,1733420207

"It's kind of like Majesty, but with even less control. You have a long linear map that you'll end up going back and forth across MANY times, doing things like recruiting peasants and building their tools. In between you'll run around more and grab coins to do these things. You're told to explore, but watch out that you don't explore ""wrong"" as when I found an old lady but didn't have a coin to interact with her, leading to her being grabbed by the bad guys and lost. Since the game gives you zero explanation about anything it was only online that I later read that this is a ""hermit"" and I was supposed to pay her to mount my horse and ride her back to the castle. I explored wrong, so she's gone.

Your gameplay is going to consist of a lot of:
1) Run across the map to your peasant hut/vagrant camp and recruit a few.
3) Run across the map to build some weapons or tools for them.
4) Run across the map to your farmers to get more coins.
5) Run across the map to your wall and order an attack.
6) Watch the attack mysteriously fizzle because for some reason only a couple of troops advance.
7) Run across the map to recruit more guys.

Seeing a pattern? There's A LOT of running across the map. It's your primary activity. There's no menus of any sort so you can only interact with things by standing on them. That means the gameplay is essentially just a loop of ""run to thing you want to interact with and hit the 'interact with coins' button.""

My greatest regret is that I gave it 2.4 hours instead of 2, so I can't refund it. Luckily I got it for $5. I'm mystified how there's more than one of this game.

If you like the idea of a hands-off type game where you're more building facilities and recruiting, buy Majesty instead.",False,1733345932

The game is just open ended enough that you can find creative ways to shortcut runs and kinda work around some upgrades that aren't as worth it.

Overall it's just very annoying constantly having to go back and see what you built destroyed even though you destroyed the portals originally (they just appear back how fun). The lands are also so long and you just so happen to have the slowest special needs horse that needs a break every 5 seconds to ride along it. Again, nothing is explained.

To be honest, sometimes I'll just conquer and island and develop it like a better version of Farmville, just to chill and listen to the music. 

I love the base game, Kingdom Two Crowns, and Kingdom Shogun; I haven't played Kingdom Deadlands because I'm not really into zombie/skulls/horror/whatever. I personally found Kingdom Norselands confusing though very beautiful and have yet to play the Call of Olympus, though it looks exciting!

What i like about the game:
1.You have different island themes , each with a unique soundtrack and some new mechanics which adds more content to the game
2.I really like the art style, the game world is more detailed now with some great backgrounds
3.Like the new bomb thing ( wish you could maybe take more than two knights with you but also if there were more than just the normal greed in the portal-have only played the game on normal)
4.The soundtrack is nice , really like the Dead Lands soundtrack and the Olympus one
5.There is a challange section 
6.Really like the addition of multiplayer

It's a shame because it feels just short of something really fantastic, there's a real lack of these cozy multiplayer games, in this genre at least, and it just feels like you run out of gimmicks by the time you hit your second island.

With the newest installment, Call of Olympus, a bunch of new powers and a slightly different story progression gives the repetitive nature of the game some more replayability.

It's a shame too cause I thought this would be one of too few games I've picked up in bundles over the years that I'm now finally trying to clear all of, that is actually fun. But so quickly it completely spoiled that fun.

Having enemies that basically wipe out everything so easily (when nothing else builds to that too) is just cheap design. And isn't telegraphed when it happens at all so you don't know it yet and it spawns on the opposite side of the map, well you'll only find out when everything is gone. And from what I've seen the general advice is move to new areas quickly as possible...which not only just serves to neuter play styles (if I wanted a restricted experience I can watch a tv show) it seems a bit counter to me to basically be constantly abandoning your kingdom in a game called kingdom.

Also think its a wildly petty move by the developer to included an accessibility option that disables achievements. If you didn't want that option to be there, don't put it in, but to put it in but disable the achievements serves no purpose other then looking down on players who might want to use it and theres a reason why other games with such options don't do just this. Get the feeling the response will be ""Well we don't want to be every other Developer"", which fine, have fun reinventing the wheel a well tested object for no real purpose.

"Game is very entertaining and it'll definitely keep you company for a lot of hours specially if you're looking to play a bit more laxed. It is a strategy game that let's you optimize your thinking skills and progressive decision making. 

One thing I hate about the game is you can't destroy buildings/towers/walls when you upgrade it. Since I was playing to accomplish some achievements, it was quite difficult to do it when you already built a lot of special buildings made by the hermits. Hence comes the strategy part so think before you build.

That is part of the challenge, I suppose.

"In its current state, the game shouldn't be called ""Verified for Steam Deck"". It's playable and very frustrating to get started and then to actually continue across sessions:

1.) Game crashes with default Proton (9.x) and won't even show up.
2.) Switching to Proton 8.x still crashes the game, but a restart fixes that issue.
3.) Your Steam Cloud saves are then lost (was already a couple hours into the game).
4.) If you play Online Co-op, your remote partner regularly crashes and has to log in again.
5.) If your Steam Deck rumbles, check for your missing online co-op and re-invite to multiplayer.

It's a shit show at the moment and very frustrating. The game itself would be fun,

"When I fired it up for the first time and saw the pixel characters I thought “Great, another cliché pixel game with terrible art but using pixels as an excuse to being stylish”, then the game started and oh boy did it look beautiful, this is how pixel games should be done in 2024. 
The gameplay is very simple and kind of calming, like a basic survival game with a little action going on. 
When night falls however is where the game’s atmosphere absolutely shines, the immersion you get from the quietness and the sudden disappearance of the music and monsters (cute monsters really) attacking the base as you scurry to defend it is just a chef’s kiss.

"I'd like to start by saying I've played through every DLC but the Call of Olympus.  I felt compelled to leave a review of this half-assed game when i was playing the Norselands expansion (beautiful colours, disappointing gameplay)

This game was really fun to start, but doesn't really have much actual progression.  Getting past your first island is fun, but once you understand that nothing really matters to the game, you can just die and respawn to get to where you were, it's kind of pointless. 

The tutorials are pointless, as there are many buildings that won't be explained in any fashion other than trial/error and the game doesn't give the option to replace buildings.

I don't see much point in buying this game, as there's not enough progression between islands and once you unlock the bomb to actually beat islands, it's pointless to go back.",False,1731116127

It's relaxing when it you start off, but slowly as you progress it gets more ominous as more monster emerge from seemingly the shadows. Playing this for the first time was amazing, I had a lot of fun. Of course I'll play it every now and then, but it probably won't ever be the same as the first time I played.

Also whilst being one of the simplest games in the world ALL of your time is wasted in that the devs dont provide a single indication of what to do, resulting in entire runs failing. 
If you finally progress to a point where you can destroy the greed tunnels, hope that you watched a guide because if you stay too long then you die... game over.. restart... little to no respect for the players time.
Do not recommend this game, especially since they seem to just rehash the same game-play loop with every successive ""DLC"" with no changes other than cosmetics.

You have to speed run, 2 builders - chop wood, then only build archers, don't waste coin on city, you have to fix boat to move on - quick quick quick. Not city builder, not tower defence.  Then after island 4 speed run back to island 1 to tower defend on day 30.  Then all challenge is pretty much done. Then it becomes zen city builder/tower defence.  Bizarre. 
Strategy? Is speed running? Was it meant to be a rogue?  I don't understand.  Shame it has potential but left me confused  and annoyed.  What are you game? What are you?",False,1730848472

I love this as a cozy game, I mainly play on peaceful (i'm not one of those who can withstand all the pressure) - and find this game so much fun. I load it up when I'm bored and in between when I can't figure out what I want to do. For a pixel game, I love all the art work as I play - and the soundtrack is pretty amazing. 

I can spend hours cutting trees, building my base, collecting people (I call them my minions) and farming. I love building everything up - and the latest installment  Call of Olympus was SO MUCH FUN. I loved all the different islands and objectives - no spoilers of course, but as someone who has played this game a lot - it's definitely still fun with the added features.

"Before I start, let me ask you something first. Are you the chosen one? Do you really believe that YOU can rule this kingdom and chase the Greed away? Huh, we will see pal, we will see.

Anyway..When I first played the game alone, I was a bit lost with all the mechanics and stuff, and I died many times, because I wasn't really ready for any of this I decided to uninstall the game. BUT (butts are for pooping) when I felt ready (wasn't that long time after) I ruled every single island that laid ahead of my slow and stupid horse (read as amazing fast and powerful mount). This game took my time and transformed that into memories I hope I don't forget. 

I aslo bought and played all DLCs available (including Call of Olympus) and I must say - thank you developers. Nord Lands and Call of Olympus really touched me and I definitelly enjoyed every single moment. Yes, the new DLC has some small bugs and things that might irritate you, but nothing that would ruin your gaming experience.

So overall 9/10 (one is kept for little repetitiveness that occurs in time)
+ sound
+ gameplay
+ economy (way you have to think about spending golds)
+ tension (when you run away from Greed)
+ if you have someone to play the game with DO SO!!!
- Repetitiveness (after a while, it might be still the same for some of you)

"Good gameplay but very poor execution. The game doesn’t tell you anything and leaves it to you to guess what something does, often wasting precious resources in the process since you only get a finite number of gems and have to spend them to see the effect. Sometimes it’s not immediately obvious, sometimes it never is leaving you wondering what you just spent your gems on. 

It also doesn’t tell you WHY some things happen. At 20 hours in I ventured into the forest to find gold(the main resource used to contract and upgrade your base) chests and out of nowhere got jumped by the enemy. Apparently, the further your base is from their spawn, the earlier they will come. This is despite the game leading you to believe they spawn at night.

Only way I figured that out was googling it, which leads me to my last gripe: you can’t even find most critical info about the mechanics in-game or online which leads to a lot of frustration, at least for me. 

If they did a better job at explaining things, or hell even bothered to at all I’d recommend it. But as it is, no I can’t.",False,1730083287

"Kingdom Two Crowns is a beautifully crafted side-scrolling strategy game that combines minimalist gameplay with a rich atmosphere. You play as a monarch, tasked with growing a kingdom and defending it from mysterious nightly threats. The game’s indirect control mechanic, where you allocate resources but don’t directly manage individuals, creates a strategic and immersive experience that feels both refreshing and engaging.

The optional co-op mode adds a wonderful layer, letting you and a partner divide responsibilities. Working together to build and protect the kingdom is not only fun but adds an extra layer of strategy. Additionally, diverse settings and mounts offer fresh experiences, keeping gameplay varied and encouraging exploration.

The pixel art is a visual highlight, creating an atmosphere that shifts with the day and weather, adding a layer of tension and immersion. Although the gameplay has a slower pace, each decision feels impactful, making the game’s steady progression rewarding.

Overall, Kingdom Two Crowns is a captivating experience that balances simple mechanics with strategic depth. It’s perfect for players who enjoy strategic planning and atmospheric games that invite exploration without rushing the experience.",True,1730057201

"Okay, if you're like I was and think that this game looks like something you'd love, but you're concerned by the reviews fluctuating between 86%-90%, I have come to offer some answers. I, being here now with 15.6 hours(soon to be more), chose to bite the bullet despite a plethora of scathing negative reviews, and I'm mostly happy that I did so. 

The gameplay here is paying the homeless NPCs to become your subjects, pay coins to assign jobs to your subjects, then gather the coins that each respective NPC generates or picks up off the floor, then finally upgrade and expand your kingdom until you have defeated all enemies. The number and type of enemies scale with days as the current crown-bearer. The enemies of the game(The Greed) are monsters that only exist to steal things of value. So they will take coins on the floor, or take the tools from your subjects rendering them jobless(costing 2-4 coins to return to work), and ultimately if your coin purse is empty, they will take your crown. Losing your crown causes a time jump, where your island has decayed and you are a new king or queen with a fresh crown. The upside of losing your crown is that the scaling difficulty will be lowered once again, so you can keep a solid amount of your previous progress while dealing with both weaker and lesser amounts of the enemies.

While I do recommend this game, I still understand those here that have refunded or left the bad reviews, because there is a fundamental issue of the game: There is a particularly specific way you have to play the first minutes of each new island(especially island 3+), and if you make any mistake in that regard, you will quickly soft-lock your game and must wait until your slow yet inevitable death. If you try to start the game without using knowledge from a guide, then your first hours of the game will be potentially spent very frustrated until you learn the mechanics to succeed.

 -- TL,DR: READ A GUIDE BEFORE STARTING TO AVOID A BAD TIME -- 


Further explanation of the issue(from what I have gathered in 15 hours):
The entire game is just spending the coins that your subjects earn for you throughout the game. Starting out, the only ways to *gain* coins(NOT woodcutting, which breaks even) are either from your hunters killing wildlife, or from the few coin chests across the map. The issue is that upgrading your base can become a large money sink very quickly. So if you were to spend the chest-coins and didn't hire enough hunters(bought more builders, or upgraded walls/archers), then your only option prior to farming is to wait for your hunters to slowly get their 1-2 coins at a time, when each base-upgrade coin expenditure is 2-3 coins minimum, going up to 8,10, even 20 coins.

If you don't spend your initial coins correctly, the game is still save-able on island 1 and 2, because there is an NPC who brings you some free coins each day if you pay her 1 coin. However, she does not spawn on islands further than 2. Which is not by itself a game breaker, but if you had played irresponsibly with your coins, which is behavior that is enabled in the first 2 islands by the Merchant, then you are just purely SOL, your hunters will quickly genocide the island's wildlife and you won't initially have enough coins to reach the farming phase, which then is the ultimate slog just waiting for more animals to spawn. At this point, just suiciding the current crown is your best bet, which isn't a great feeling. Fortunately, it only takes this occurrence once or twice to fully understand how to avoid it, but that is still a good amount of time effectively wasted on miserable gameplay.

The most enjoyable method to win the game is to start by only spending your precious few coins on hunters and upgrading your campsite until you unlock farmers, and then only buying up the land until you reach a farming plot(which is designated by a small stream of water on the walkable land). Farmers + farm plot = unlimited and constant unconditional cash(excluding the Winter mechanic). Then, and only then, do you get the freedom to actually upgrade your walls and archer towers. After you get your first farm on each island, if you use that income to get every farm plot on the map and get a stupid amount of farmers, then soon you will have an actual endless supply of coins, like you literally must be constantly dropping coins from your bag to avoid the ""overflowing coin bag"" mechanic where some coins can be dropped into the ocean losing them permanently, and your property will be a wasteland of infinite floating coins. The game is prepared for this too; once you upgrade your campsite enough, it becomes a bank where you can drop any amount of coins during the day and they will be permanently stored inside, safe from the enemy, and also gaining interest.

So, if you can get the mechanics down and not run out of coins prior to unlocking farming, the game is absolutely an enjoyable experience, and the dlc re-skins of the game are an interesting concept that I also enjoyed. Grab the game if it goes on sale!",True,1729994088

"/ Review was written excluding the Call of Olympus DLC which has added new features and further tweaked the game mechanics /

One of the best games I've played in a while. It's not perfect (slightly wonky AI sometimes, eg.) but I find it all the more charming. A sidescrolling base builder / tower defence with different mounts and an easy to understand gameplay that leaves wiggle room room to experiment. The gameplay can be repetitive, but in a good way. Every DLC is unique, some more than others. E.g. the optics change, the mounts' abilities change but the core gameplay stays the same. The different DLCs give a nice twist on the base game with various added difficulties and there is an option to choose between several difficulty settings at the beginning of each campaign.

You can easily finish the campaign(s if you count the DLCs) in single player but where this game really shines is the two person multiplayer. Not to mention the super relaxing music and the truly gorgeous pixel art (no, seriously, I find it's super harmonious and pleasing to look at even for long periods of time). There's a tutorial which can be a little annoying if you've managed to figure out what the tutorial wants to explain to you because you have to repeat it to get rid of the, imo unobtrusive but noticeable, ghost. The game is easy to grasp and fun to play on repeat. I've spent entire playthroughs in a meditative, relaxed state (most of the time; once in a while there'll be an adrenaline spike but it's rare if you pay a little attention to what you do).",True,1729981100

"Sorry, this is a badly designed game, and I will die on this hill(land).
It looks nice, the idea is cool (but actually much more shallow than it seems), the environment and initial mystery are appealing and make you keep going.

But it is so damn tedious and slow. For no reason. If that's what you wanted then congratulations, you've made me stop playing.
I don't want to endlessly go back and forth, left and right, to wait for animals to spawn for my archers to shoot so I can get a few more coins to rebuild an entire ship so I can just revisit a previous island because I need one thing from there. Yes, you can try to get coins a few different ways, but they are all unnecessarily slow and pointless. It's the opposite of fun and doesn't respect my time.
The greed is again a nice idea, executed in a very shallow way. 
I thought the game was going to be so complex with so many mysteries to unravel and explore.. nope, it's just going back and forth on the same island copied 5 times, going through the same boring steps to build your village, and recruiting the final units to win.

There is actually so much potential in the idea, imagine if you could quickly transport around, imagine if you had different and interesting enemies and items, imagine if you had an actual story or conditions that change your playthrough, imagine a complex economy and lots of buildings with choices of what to make.
Nope, just go left or right on the quickly tiring mount and collect coins and do the same thing over and over and over. I'm over it.",False,1729946512
"A unique indie experience, worth every penny!",True,1729945833
"This game is mechanically rather simple but very enjoyable to play. In my opinion it's absolutely worth buying when it is on sale. I think words and phrases like ""micro"" ""minimalist"" ""small scale strategy"" best describe this game.

You start on a hostile map, you try to collect coins to build a little town. You collect coins by opening chests scattered across the map and by hiring villagers to hunt animals and cut down trees to make room for your towns growth. You upgrade the town while trying to both explore the map for secrets and objectives while also defending your base from nightly invasions.

You unlock different unit types depending on how upgraded your town is and which buildings you've invested in. Depending on the different DLC like Shogun, Olympus, Norselands or Deadlands the units you have access to will change to fit the theme of the DLC. So you'll get ninjas in Shogun, barbarians in Norselands, etc. It's pretty fun but there isn't a lot strategically going on with the different unit types.

You eventually unlock the ability to send waves of attacks using the units you've recruited in order to take down the portals that are spawning monsters on your map. This is the main loop of the game and is enjoyable although it can become repetitive after a few runs back to back.

There are also challenge islands, they offer unique challenges to complete on premade islands. There is also a rotating daily challenge island that has some variation to what it offers. These feel more like puzzles than the main game mode, and I rather enjoyed playing them.

Ultimately all I wanted from this game was more. More upgrades, more units, more buildings, more maps, more ways to spend my coins. I hope in the next version of the game the devs decide to go a little less minimalist and really push their ideas to the next level.",True,1729945512

"Teaboy's Basic(ish) Reviews....I read a lot of reviews when looking at games on Steam, and it quickly gets tiring – those who write involved, down to the micron scale reviews, although helpful, end up like looking at War & Peace when you’ve only got time for a quick 5 minute dump!  This is middle of the road and to the point – not easy for me as I tend towards sesquipedalian loquaciousness!  Vociferously Verbose?  Alright, verbal diarrhoea.  (Although I hate panning a developer’s work and all the time, effort and love they put into designing these – it is their life after all – this is my honest, personal opinion of my level of enjoyment.  Sorry devs!).  

A note on time played:  My Steam clock does not seem to work properly, indeed, it even minuses time on occasion!  Plus, I have a tendency to wander off and leave games running at times, so time played may not be entirely accurate!  


Teaboy’s Tonsil Titillators or Toenail Titbits!  (Rating)  

Tonsil Tickler (Totally Tops):  The frenchy of which you always dreamt!  To quote a master, “She’s got a tongue like an electric eel and she likes the taste of a Man’s tonsils!”.  An absolute masterpiece and joy to play.  

The Tits (Terrific):  Everyone loves playing with these!  Not THE best bit, but such fun on their own you can be lost for hours....mmmm.  What most games you really like score – perfection is so rare after all.   

Torso Teaser (Taker of your Time):  It’s a flat stomach....sure it’s nice to look at, run your fingers over, slobber on a bit, sometimes that bellybutton gets your motor running....but it's just basically the corridor between the two ‘gaming rooms’.  The definitive ‘Meh’ - the middle ‘sideways thumb’ option for which everyone on Steam cries.  

Todger/Tadger & (scroTum) Taters (Tedious):  Is it an ‘a’ or is it an ‘o’?  Who cares!  The meat can be fun to play with for about 5 minutes of your entire day, the rest it just hangs there and generally gets in the way of doing something else.  The main problem of course, is the two veg sticking to your inside thigh.  This is what this game feels like – the occasional/rare bouts of fun, the rest bobbing like a 19th century British Policeman (now you know why!).  

Toenail Tornado (Total Toss):  A playthrough so appalling it’s like being trapped in a Turkish sauna with the ugliest, hairiest, fattest, sweatiest beast of a neolithic hominid who’s trimming his toenails using pliers and the splinters are reminiscent of a scene from the Normandy Landings.  My god how did this get released!?  


Teaboy Touts (Score):  Tit Tease


The Review:  

Housefull of kittens managed to delete my review as I was typing it - rage quit^^.  So let's be quick....

This game seems easier than New Lands (that final stage....grrrr) but does have difficulty settings whereas the predecessor did not - I played on normal after the rage of that last level above.  Very sadly it is only 5 islands - check my playtime between this and the other, it's a world of difference!  The only really hard part was the fact that the final island throws breeders at you on like day 5 or 6!  From both sides!  With flyers!  It is obviously deliberately designed to slaughter you and artificially extend the game.  You are forced to 'stock up' on troops from a previous island (it always throws you back to Island 1 with all its limitations when you die) and launch another attack on Island 5.  Do this several times, as each time you return to an island your castle is partly destroyed - but this means it is also partly built.  Ergo, you can build it to another level each time until strong enough to survive.  

Once this is done, the game is over.  I've been to all islands multiple times but there is nothing more to do other than kill all portals.  This seriously limits the life of this game.  

It has more upgrades to buildings, a spearman that literally fishes and the fish turns into a coin and whom I believe can stab THROUGH the walls, the knight from the previous game now is a maceman and can be UPGRADED to a knight after finding the Knight Horse on its little battlefield with a small stone monument.  There are more 'rides' and more special guys you can give a ride to whom upgrade your towers/walls in different ways.  

Problem is, there aren't enough 'jewels' which is a new addition needed to unlock all the above.  Once unlocked, they do stay unlocked, although you have to pay in coin every time you redo an island, and the costs are a lot higher than the previous iteration of the game.  Each island only has one special and one ride, you do keep your ride as you change island, but if you die you have to go to the specific island if you want a specific ride and/or special guy (IF you have unlocked them - remember, not enough jewels to unlock them all).  

It is good, it's the same game with a few tweaks (like changing a couple of frigging buttons AGAIN - stop doing this devs!) and has the same frustration/addiction ratio which keeps you coming back the next day when you swore it was dead to you after that ricockulously unfair death (dying makes you restart from Island 1 but building progress remains, so whatever you've built on each island stays built, bar your castle that can 'degrade'.  However, I found that after beating the Greed on each island, then nothing degraded).  It has, finally, an upgrade to enclose towers so those darn tootin' flyers can't get 'em!  But it did have a weird new baddie that can outrun your horse and steals the crown - very unfair!  Oh, and you now go INTO the cave to destroy the Greed with a huge bomb ;)  Although remember to run like fun for the exit when you set it off or you die!  

I almost never do dlc, and it's not received good reports anyway.  I found no glitches other than a little frame jump and then only rarely.  Good game, but somehow shorter than the others - actually shorter than the free one, even with going back over islands!  This could be because I knew the basics already....but still not good for the 3rd iteration.",True,1729883686

"Some of the ideas this game has are cool and all, but it is unacceptably broken and keeps breaking in different ways every patch.

Here is just a list of things I've encountered within the last 20h of gameplay:
- Recently, since the last patch, whenever I start the game with a friend, for about 40 minutes there will be insane network lag ingame, making the game unplayable for player 2. Our ping towards eachother is 20ms, no idea why Kingom Two Crowns lags like that.
- When you move walls, interactibles in and around will move, this sometimes bugs out. I had 4 spear shops within one side of the kingdom and only one of them was an actual serverside building.
- We had to restart a bunch because the builder AI would get stuck and not be able to finish a task. Sometimes they would run to the absolute edge of the map and keep running against the wall without stopping.
- From one day to another, I as player 2 lost a bag upgrade. We had saved and loaded before without losing anything. All my money was gone, so were my collectables. I never got that upgrade back.
- I stopped building towers because the archer/slingshot unit would just not mount them, no matter how many you had around, probably has something to do with the slingshot people you took from another island being treated differently in code.
- Right now, we literally can not progress because we are having a bloodmoon with some new enemy type, which, whenever it is attacked, crashes player 1s game. We tried file verification, reinstalling, none work. This is not even a softlock anymore, its a hardlock.

When I went to report one of the bugs I got redirected to the companies Jira.
Listen guys, I am not at work. I will not use your Jira like some playtester. I am a player who bought something that should have been tested and should be working. I have lost all faith in this game getting better because every single patch seems to be introducing more issues.

"I've tried to like this game and put plenty of hours into trying to make it work.
That being said, getting overwhelmed with zero options for personal defence and losing progress is frustrating to the point of not being a challenge, just a waste of time.
No option to steal back the crown if something gets it so you may as well quit and restart then and there.
No variety to units or placement of structures means most of the time is just running from point A to point C to point B and back to point A.
Units will spew coins at you to the point that 90% of them fall out of the coin purse. An upgrade to the size of the purse would be helpful, if not required.
 
Problem is, after everything, you can still lose it all from losing your crown because you have no option besides run away.

"Мне не понравилось и я скажу почему
1) Темп игры черезвычайно медленный, намеренно высасывающий из вас всю душу. Я понимаю что игра может быть была так задумана как чилл геймплей , но этот самый геймплей можно ускорить раз 100 для людей которым нравится нажимать чуть больше чем одну кнопку в минуту. 
2) И без того медленный темп игры замедляется тем, что чтобы играть в эту игру адекватно вам всегда нужен тиммейт , либо постоянно развивать одну сторону, почему? потому что если вы на секунду отпустите строителя он побежит на противоположенную сторону через пол карты строить уже почти построенную стену или сломать одно дерево и прибежать обратно. В игре нет настройки строителей или грамотного распределения лучников и тому подобное, и оно не всегда и нужно, но когда нужно отсутствие этого убивает , в буквальном смысле. По началу это лишь десятки секунд, но на дальней дистанции очевидно что из-за таких моментов игрок теряет до часу или нескольких часов времени геймплея, просто ожидая строителя или то, что из-за таких приколов на старте строитель не успевает построить стену и башню и вам тупо сносят фермеров. 
3) Потерял алмазы начинай заново. Я видел на вики что якобы если сломать портал с какой то там стороны то вам вернут алмазы... замечательно , а как мне быть если меня били и алмазы упали в реку? Это гг 
Игра пьет вашу кровь, в прямом смысле, это не чилл . вы должны спидранить и торопиться пойти на второй остров, открыть камень, получить алмазы, вернуться на первый открыть там все, снести порталы и так в спешке вы должны спидранить острова , потому что ваша задержка задержит вас еще больше в будущем на других островах итого=миллион проебанного времени впустую.
4) куча непродуманных механик, неудобное управление , казалось бы как? w a s d не больше, да представляете чтобы было чутка удобнее надо добавить еще пару клавиш как оказалось, например в настройках выборку чтобы юниты не выбрасывали в вас ( в море когда у вас полный кошель ) деньги и ты бежишь с одной стороны , потратил деньги, возвращаешься началась зима, а все, денег нет у них, потому что они все выбросили в тебя и им насрать что ты бежал мимо них а не медленно шел и даже не останавливался. Нет , серьезно, порой они дают денег нехотя только когда ты останавливаешься а иногда на похуй бросают в реку зная что у тебя полный кошель.
5) В коде игры нет даже намека на интеллект нпс из-за чего происходят наиглупейшие ситуации , как например когда у вас две катапульты с каждой стороны по одной. И все вроде бы хорошо, но вот наступает кровавая луна и волны идут с обеих сторон, и тут одна катапульта решает настал мой час и ебашит пол карты до другой стороны стены пока вас нещадно зато сладко ебут в очко великаны 10/10
6) в игре где есть кооп есть имбовый маунт в виде гарпии которая летит как гоночный балид и есть все остальные маунты полезность которых крайне сомнительна из всех могу выделить только медведя и оленя. Но медведь не играбелен, ибо слишком медленный и запыхается а в лейтгейме вам важно быстро добираться от одного конца к другому, ососбенно зимой когда нужно экономить деньги, вы не будете тратить деньги на телепорт или когда он попросту еще не сделан. Лось неплохой, очень даже, но он в сто раз хуже грифона и тут вопрос а если игра кооп разве нельзя дать второму игроку что-то настолько же стоящее? Есть конь который бафает армию но это просто смешно. Или ящерица плюющая огнем, про нее я вообще молчу, кулдаун шарика с огнем это пиздец, а ну и запыхается как урод. 

Вывод - много чего еще можно сказать , если честно игра действительно неплохая , я взял ее по скидке за два доллара и другу в подарок, но в действительности я жалею о потраченном времени и деньгах. Игра мне тупо не дала абсолютно никаких эмоций. Обсираться это нормально , не нормально когда в твоей игре нет возможности камбекать и учиться на ошибках , тем более когда она в таком стиле. В игре очень много недостатков , вышеперечисленное лишь часть из накипевшего и первое что вспомнилось. Не советую, даже для игры с девушкой.",False,1729638566

exploding the caves can be buggy but there's a way to make it work if you switch it to two player mode. It's all worth it to watch those lil homeless guys pick up your money and the run around doing your bidding. I would recommend this game and have recommended this game to my friends.,True,1729619336
"A delightful game, which is as simple as it is complex. Beautiful, simple, pixel graphics, but what an array of weathers, sunsets and daylight hues. Simple game mechanics, and such a complex world to explore and understand. Such a simple game design, and yet so wonderfully captivating. I've been playing this for hours and hours. It's so compelling.",True,1729619145
"Recommendation is tentative based on my limited play time.

Kingdom: Two Crowns is true to its user-defined tags, though I would say most apply in a limited sense with the emphasis being on the experience as a whole. It's a tower defense, but you're not deciding where to place towers, nor choosing between upgrades that change their function. It's a city builder, but you're not designing a city so much as paying to repair and expand on what's already there. Perhaps the most apt tag is ""Minimalist"" as most of the game seems to be spent riding your horse back and forth across your ever widening camp/base to collect coins--your primary method of interacting with the game's systems. However, I'd say this title unfortunately falls on the simplistic side of minimalist.

The coin system is pretty neat, for what it's worth. You tap down to drop coins, and hold down to spend coins on coin prompts in the environment. Dropping a coin for a beggar turns them into your subject; they'll run to your base and, if there's a tool available, start performing a job. Holding down at the prompt for the bowyer or smith in your base will buy bows and tools, respectively. Holding down on environmental prompts spends coin to chop down trees, build farms, walls, defenses, and other structures. Again, this can only be done at the prompts, so you're not placing buildings following any kind of strategy or aesthetic. Things go where they go.

The gameplay loop is quite repetitive, and seems to revolve around locating the base, upgrading and expanding the base, collecting coins from subjects to expand further, defending against nightly attacks from the Greed (hooded nighttime monsters that steal whatever they can), and repairing the ship to sail off to another location and start again.

And I think that's where it loses me. After clearing the first map and getting about halfway through the second, I found I didn't really have any desire to keep going. There was no indication of progress, nothing at all really to differentiate the experience of the second map from the first (aside from the layout of the resources and buildings, perhaps generate semi-randomly). If I was making progress toward unlocking new stuff to use, that wasn't communicated at all.

In fact, it seems a choice was made at the design level to keep communication with the player to a bare minimum. I respect the choice, and from an aesthetic and accessibility angle, I do appreciate it. However, I'm not sure it entirely works here. Because so few choices are being made while riding from one side of the base to the other, some communication about *why* the player should keep doing this would be very welcome. Unfortunately, that didn't happen during my experience.

Visually, I love the aesthetic. The water reflections are gorgeous, the pixel art is stylishly chunky with smooth animation, and the lighting does *so much* to set the tone. Colors are appropriately dull or saturated to fit the situation. It's very, very pleasant to look at. The music is also quite nice from what I heard. Atmospheric and mellow, melding with the visuals without drawing focus.

Despite my issues with it, every part of this game seems to have been crafted with care, and that's why I'm giving it a weak recommendation. I'm surprised that a game tagged as a tower defense city builder isn't for me, because that sounds like it'd be my jam. This one is not, but it could certainly be yours, so it's worth picking up to find out.",True,1729616319
"I feel like its prettiness is all it has going for it. You are basically just a politician and that's it. I felt pretty useless for the entire duration of playing the game. Just go pick up coins, invest it into something, get mugged since you can't defend yourself and your horse is slower than some small dude in a hoodie even while sprinting... Yea it's not really fun. I think there is also a lot of RNG involved and there are no explanations to anything whatsoever... Was I supposed to play the devs previous games to understand what is going on, is what I was asking myself. So the only thing that kept me playing is the exploration aspect, which had diminishing returns. Eventually I gave up, because the bizarre panning of the camera made me motion sick. Not like there was a real goal other than to keep rebuilding ships. Just to wrap this review up, the multiplayer aspect seems like it's just there so 2 people can do their own thing. Each has their own coin pouch, so either each person focuses on one side of the base, or one person is the collector while the other person does the investing... Without coordination, this feature is just a hindrance and doesn't really make it more fun.",False,1729612982

There are a few design quirks that I wish were added to the game (e.g. being able to clear forests around portals/ places of interest) and I am tempted by the other DLC's - if they have new gameplay.

(I’m not going to continue to play on a save with a dead character.) when your crown gets knocked off an enemy will pick it up and run away into a portal with it. Forcing you to pick a new character and start back at the starting island. Basically if your crown gets knocked off there is nothing you can do about it and if you’re looking for that perfect run completely ruins the game.

"I am a passionate fan of the Kingdom series and have thoroughly enjoyed exploring its world. However, after reviewing community feedback on platforms like Reddit, I’ve gathered some suggestions that could enhance the gameplay experience and further enrich the Kingdom universe.

1. Couch Co-op & Multiplayer:
Many players, myself included, deeply appreciate the co-op experience in Kingdom. It provides a fantastic way for couples or friends to bond while strategizing together. Expanding this feature and making it smoother or more versatile (e.g., allowing drop-in/out multiplayer or cross-platform play) would significantly increase the game’s replayability and appeal.

2. Dynamic Enemy Encounters:
Some players feel that the threat from enemies becomes repetitive over time. Introducing more variety in enemy types, including unique bosses, and randomizing attack patterns or adding ""daylight threats"" could increase the sense of danger and make battles more strategic.

3. Resource Management Improvements:
The current system of managing money in the bag is a source of frustration for some players. Coins often fall out when the bag is full, leading to unnecessary losses. A simple fix could be to allow players to manage the bag more efficiently, dropping specific resources like gems or money at will. Additionally, adding more resources like wood and food as pivotal elements in building could add complexity without overwhelming players.

4. Village Life & Job Assignment:
Giving more control over the assignment of jobs to villagers (e.g., prioritizing certain tasks over others) would allow players to feel more in command of their kingdom. This could also extend to more dynamic village life, with unique professions and a more visibly bustling village as it grows.

5. Replayability & Progression:
Once players complete the game, replayability can feel limited. Adding a deeper progression system or side quests that provide new challenges or rewards—such as special mounts, treasures, or even new units—would encourage players to dive back in. Seasonal events or campaign variations could also refresh the experience.

6. Mounts & Transportation:
The current mount stamina system can feel restrictive, especially when players must frequently stop for rest. Offering upgrades or consumables that temporarily restore mount stamina would make traversal less frustrating. Furthermore, allowing knights or other high-ranking units to use mounts could introduce new strategic possibilities in battles.

These ideas come from a place of admiration for your work on Kingdom. I hope you find these suggestions useful as you continue developing and refining the game. I’m excited to see how Kingdom evolves in future updates and releases.

"This game is great. I recommend going into this game blind and only looking specific things up on the wiki when you want to know what something does or how to use it (like what a special mount does or what a building/character does). There's pretty good timing when unlocking new things so it doesn't feel like you have to grind a ton before you actually make progress, and whenever I felt annoyed with a mechanic, it wouldn't be too long before another mechanic is introduced that is designed to make that other mechanic easier. That's part of the reason I think going in blind is better, just because a lot of stuff in the game surprised me in a, ""Wow! I wasn't expecting that to do that! That makes that other thing so much easier!"" The art design helps a lot with it too, just because a few things are a bit difficult to make out at first but then you unlock it and the reveal makes sense and is usually pretty cool. Also the animations are insanely well done and smooth, especially for being pixel art animations, and generally the game is just really nice to look at. 

I want to be fair and try and list some negatives, but I haven't really played enough yet to know if some of my problems will be resolved after I've progressed some more. I only have two real complaints, one is that there is this glitch where some of my guys will just run off into the wilderness never to return. Saving and reloading does make them come back sometimes but mostly they'll die, and if I don't actually witness them running off I'll just have randomly less dudes to work with which stinks. However this RARELY happens and only really occurred when I had absolutely oodles of them so it didn't affect me terribly. The other is that the walls can sometimes be generated really far apart from each other, which can make it difficult in mid/late game when upgrading them because your militia people will run all the way back to the previously built wall and then have to run all the way back once it's done being built, and a lot of the time you'll be upgrading it multiple times and max walls take FOREVER to build so it's pretty much guaranteed your defensive guys will be too far away when the wall is finally built and night time comes. This wouldn't be the biggest issue if you could choose which builds get priority, but a lot of the time the wall will get queued behind other builds and your builders won't get to it for a while, which further increases how much time it takes to finish which can be detrimental when the enemies get tough. This could just be me not having enough builders, but a lot of the times the builder that gets put on the walls are the furthest away and it takes forever for them to walk over. That kind of deviated to me complaining about the AI but all in all I think the procedural generation could be adjusted a bit, at least for the walls. Now, I'm no game dev, but just as the player looking at it, I think either having the walls themselves be naturally spaced slightly closer together or maybe having a way to place your own (though I can imagine how that could be abused so probably not) would be kind of cool. Also maybe having a priority thing using the coins. Like if I wanted a wall to be built first I could drop a coin in front of it after I buy it, It'll disappear, and the closest builder would reprioritize. Another thing I think maybe the walls when being upgraded should remain there so the militia guys don't run away when upgrading. If the enemies hit it while upgrading it could just cancel the upgrade and eat your coins (so you'd have to time it).

This is my first review I've ever done for any game I've played, and despite the complaints I listed, I think this really is a great game that's worth playing.",True,1729325623

Its going to suck at the start a bit, but when you get the hang of it a few hours in. It's pretty simple and fun, a meditating game you can play with one hand and can have fun with and it still poses a challenge of course but it's just very calm.

I wont lie, this game won't change your life but its a pretty nice indie game you can turn your attention too every now and then. 

Got a few bugs with multiplayer but I advise singleplayer anyway, just if you have a mate who already has it or you like it A LOT then try it with a friend.


Is it worth the pricetag? No. It's overpriced and you should wait for it to go on sale - My advice? Don't grab it for anything over $10.

"[h1] A game to be played with friends otherwise you'll get bored [/h1]

Definitely a fun game but if you're grinding it by yourself it gets kind of repetitive and frustrating. The game almost feels like it encourages coop game play by how exponentially difficult the campaign becomes after the 3rd-ish island (or I'm just bad which could be a serious possibility). It's just after a certain point, even if you come to an island on a filled ship, you're bound to be absolutely obliterated unless someone else is making coin. This is when the difficulty is at normal so I really can't imagine a higher one.

There's also a few bugs I've noticed that have diminished my care for if I win or lose a portal (ie. my builders/workers getting stuck behind dock portals) and a definite need for updates to worker programming (ie. builders attempting to build at night and running way far out and getting immediately punched thus wasting coins and vagrants) but honestly that could just be coming with updates. 

I'd say altogether its fun at first but this might not be the game for a lonesome grind campaign to turn your brain off. There are things I don't like that I unfortunately didn't realize until after I started playing:
- No combat/very little combat function in game. You're basically made to feel helpless as you watch your servants die in front of you while you attempt to flap your little wings every 1 minute to drive the hoard back. Even a sword you can buy on island once would be more satisfying.
- The portals feel like a cheap way to solve the problem that the mounts are kind of lame at travel. I understand the realistic aspect of stamina and speed dependent on mounts but especially when you're lonesome grinding, this is what causes those feelings of tediousness and boredom and significantly diminishes that dopamine hit of victory when you take out a greed portal. Just make them faster; at least for solo players.
- And on that note, I feel like there's no compensation when you don't have a buddy to back up the other side of the kingdom. I'll be on one side and help there and then travel to the other side and boom all of my walls are missing, half the troops are vagrants, and now I have to spend so much in repairs.
- The islands aren't super different, I think it could be a really really useful thing if they looked different and to help ward off that familiarity that creates boredom. Yes, each island has different things on it but they feel useless after the 3rd island. Honestly, this one is more of a ""what I hope comes of the game"" like a game mode of endless islands (I don't know if they already have this so please correct me if I'm wrong).

TL;DR Game is great for coop but kind of buggy and needs more updates to make it not boring for solo play. [b] Still recommend for the sale NOT full price. [/b]",True,1729286107

"As much as I want to like this game, many factors just push me away from it. The game play is too simple, you don't have good control over anything and can often get frustrated with how stupid your workers act. It also never really evolves, you never have anything that radically changes game play, from start to end you will still be walking back and forth holding down. The only time that anything changes is the last two lands having boss waves after a portal is destroyed, which can either be intensly cruel even with dozens of troops and fully upgraded walls, or piss easy if you have a dragon mount. Though a good difficulty would actually hardly matter since the only tactic you can practice for most of the game is hoarding more troops. At the end of the day this game is mostly a time waster with no mechanic speaking to this fact more than decay. The longer you are away from a town the more it decays, which always makes me question truly why, especially on completed maps. And whenever you lose your crown all kingdoms immedietly gain 100 days of decay, this would be an understandable setback for losing the crown, if losing the crown actually meant much else. Kingdoms decay and thats it, just more time to waste around while all the enemy waves reset to day 1. It's peddling without going very far. Overall this is a game to kill time, but in my personal opinion there are better time wasters that cause less frustration.",False,1729277602

"Sadly i cant really recommend it even though i think this game had alot of potential. But you just walk right and left the whole time. Thats it. You collect coins from your workers to grow your empire, while the enmies that attack you every night get stronger. The gameplay loop doesnt get more exciting or deep. 5 hours in you still walk left and right, just for far far longer. And then there is the ship you can build to unlock new islands. Very exciting i thought. On these islands you can find and build mines to build stronger castle walls. But well, when you arrive, you have a new island where you start all over again. You start small, and expand your empire. Nothing about the boring ass, walking left and right ass gameplay changes. You can just do it all over again. And the best part, once you come to your first island, youll realize it decays over time. So you better be quick.

"[h1]A Relaxing but Challenging Journey[/h1]

Kingdom Two Crowns is a surprisingly relaxing yet challenging game—a combination that feels unique. 
The gameplay is simple, requiring only 1-2 buttons aside from movement controls. However, there are many hidden mechanics that you'll need to discover on your own or learn through trial and error. 

Completing a single playthrough can take anywhere from 5 to 10 hours, or even more on your first attempt, which feels quite long for a strategy game. That might be the only downside I can think of. 
Despite this, it's a simple yet very enjoyable game that's definitely worth a try.

I have tried multiple times to play a co-op game with my friend; immediately after launching I notice some desync issues. By the time we reach the third island, I am constantly being disconnected and/or desyncing. I am prevented from interacting with coins or villagers, and I inevitably am kicked out of the game and have to rejoin. This is every 3 minutes or so. I know this is not an issue with my internet, as I have played multiple multi-player games with my friend and never had any issues. I don't pretend to know how they do their networking, but we are in the same geographical area and shouldn't be having such a huge difference in experience.

"TL:DR It's quite endearing on the first playthrough but expect to have exhausted what the game has to offer by the 6-10 hour mark, DLC's included.

The game's quite pretty, it's a shame it's pretty boring... After you've cleared one land, you've cleared them all. Once you've got a grasp on actually playing the game you realize how hollow it is. I got the gist of it pretty early and the hours thereafter came from repeated playthroughs, years apart.

The visuals are some of the best I've ever seen as far as pixel graphics go and the soundtrack is pretty great. However, controlling your subjects (or should i say lack thereof) in combination with the meandering gameplay of waiting for crops to grow, waiting for archers to hunt animals, waiting for days to pass, waiting for workers to build, etc. This is the core gameplay loop: **waiting**. With little to do besides walk left and right to see if your subjects have finished their tasks or acquire meager upgrades. These made this game an absolute slog for me. Bugs are a little too numerous for how simple of a game this is and the game could've done with some more polish like how archer towers remain empty when you have dozens of extra archers or how the hermits just commit suicide the second enemies approach while you're carrying them.

All the DLC's are pretty much the base game with maybe a new mount or two and a new coat of paint, I wouldn't say any of them are particularly worth it. As I said before: ""After you've cleared one land, you've cleared them all.""

This bits more for me:
Skins you have to pay for in a singleplayer/couch coop game is absolutely insane to me. 
While I'm at it: Kingdom ""2.0"" is also crazy to me, you added save files and the ability to disable the tutorial and that's pretty much it. Those are a tweak or a hotfix **TOPS**, when I saw 2.0 I didn't read the patch notes because I thought they added a lot of content and didn't want to spoil it for myself because part of the fun of this game was discovering the mechanics.

"Game is fun and amazing to play especially in coop. I loved the original, but my gripe with the game is the slew of bugs I found out about while searching forums to find a fix for a game bricking bug. Yes that's right your ENTIRE GAME CAN BE BRICKED BY A BUG. My issue came from attacking the 3rd cave and after clearing it and escaping with my crown intact (even got the achievement) I was glitched inside the side of the mountain and the game played the post game stats as if I died. I was like man that sucks, ig I died. NOPE. I was very much alive and stuck in the mountain there are no separate saves just the one continuous one and you cant revert it cause the game drops a save right after you defeat the cave... Whatever, I got over that gripe and went to start a new game, sucks to lose all that progress but now I just won't go near cave 3, WRONG. The AI after buying the bowman won't hunt rabbits, and therefore move on to the next step in the first level. Here is where I found out that not only was my save soft locked, but now my entire game was hardlocked/bricked. I dived into forums talking about save file editing trying to find something to potentially edit my player position and fix the AI, however the save file that the game saves is a mess of true false statements that are checked overly reduntantly, and is a nightmare to navigate. After 3-4 hours of editing saving recompiling, plugging files back in seeing if it worked and seeing it didn't work. I've decided to leave a negative review. The game is great and fun, but when you encounter a bug its game breaking. Best solution that I found was to disable cloud syncing, wiping the save file COMPLETELY, and making sure any cloud file is also gone (as the game will just constantly throw the cloud file back into your game again.) Please devs fix this game its so much fun. I found forums containing this issue and so many more that are still persistent TO THIS DAY, and people are still making comments asking for solutions or having bugs. If that's to much to ask at least make save file manipulating easier, or bare minimum have SEPARATE SAVES. Everything being saved into one persistent save file is absolutely insane, my biggest gripe could've been solved if the autosave system made at least backup saves up to at least 3 days before.

"4/10 

The game's serious lack of in game tutorials stunts any ""fun"" the player might have after the initial round of exploration with hours of digging around wikis/spoilers. 

Worse, there are MANY instances where Game Breaking Bugs ruin a run. The least of which are when NPC's stop doing what there supposed to be doing. I.e Archer won't hunt, Pike men wont fish, and Builders that Ignore trees that are marked, have a clean path to them and are not near enemies. 
Its insidious! its not all of your NPCS all of the time, sometimes you'll just be making 1/3rds less money if you dont save and quit the game. . . 

EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. (in game)

The average player has neither the time or tools to compare mounts.

you waste alot of time and resources GUESSING what next mount will do. then spend alot of time guessing what the shining eye of a warhorse will do. what about the flap of a griffyn? 

There is a 10 paragraph explanation about the sunbathing mechanics of the lizard mount on the wiki . . .

The game wont tell you what monuments do what, NPCS from monuments wander out of town only to be kidnapped, or hop off your horse before reaching your destination, game doesnt tell you that you can take them between islands.

Game doesnt tell you gems are finite, game doesnt tell you that breaking portal can get you gems back, but once there gone you wont be seeing those until the last 5% of the game anyway. Needless making the game harder for the uninformed. . .

 - Getting randomly swarmed by an impossible wave of flying creatures on day 0 traveling to the next island.

 - All the archer towers remaining empty, despite having 80 of them wandering aimlessly on the ground.

 - Unable to summon the knights sometimes.  Oddly enough, sometimes traveling to a new island with them fixes it, but often only accompanied by 2-4 archers, even though I hired dozens that just wander aimlessly shooting rabbits.

 - Having a night sometimes get stuck and last forever.

 - Many ways to lock your game like hiring the wrong character first, or sub-optimally spending your coins or gems, and have to start completely over if you're not careful - and even sometimes if you are.  

It wouldn't be so bad if you could actually restore an earlier save, but the game always seems to save both the cloud and local storage together at the worst possible moment.  Also messing with stuff that isn't the game's save file by blindly uploading the ENTIRE folder, and not just the one file.  For example, \AppData\LocalLow\noio\KingdomTwoCrowns\Release\global-v35 is the save file, and if you make a copy called global-v35.bak, it will upload it to the cloud (as well as anything else you put in that folder), and if you updated it locally while playing, it will replace your local copy with the cloud copy when you close the game, and you lose all your progress since the last time you launched the game.

It might be worth continuing to play if you have a save editor, or at least a rolling backup so many of these game breaking bugs you come across don't ruin hours of play time.  I'm glad to be done with this piece of trash.

Also, insult to injury, why are there achievements for this game that only are possible if you buy a DLC.  Kinda scummy to do stuff like that.  Keep all relevant achievements to their own game.

"Edit at 9 hours: I scrapped my third run and began a fourth, implementing what I felt I'd learned. I ran out of text space so I'm not detailing anything.
What will make or break this game for players is how tedious it is to run around the map. 99% of the time is just running back and forth, for hours upon hours. If you fail, repeat most of that and try again.
The one detail I will mention is I destroyed a portal. It was unnecessarily hard. I then noticed it came back before I could destroy the second. I turned the game off.
I'm changing my review to ""Not Recommended"". I just can't get behind a game that actively disrespects the player's time. When you finish something and you just feel angry and like hours of your life were just wasted, it's not worth it. If movement weren't as tedious as it is, that'd be enough to change this game from ""bullsh*t"" to ""gem"". Luckily for the developers, enough people disagree with me.

Original review: At 5.5 hours, it's too early for me to leave a very detailed review. So I'm going to focus on some of the issues I'm facing right now that have me on the fence. Clearly, there are a lot of people who love it and I think there is plenty to love here, but in a way this game is harsher than you might expect - you may even consider some things to be unfair - so I want to mention a couple things that are bugging me, as a beginner. I am writing this from a semi-emotional state, I suppose, since I'm currently frustrated, but I'll be as fair as I know how to be.

First, I can comfortably say that this is a fun game, and I do see how it can be addictive, at least for a while.
The game is kind of slow. You keep busy, but you're always waiting on a timer, which is the day/night cycle.
As you're starting out, you're not going to know how things work, so you will keep doing everything you're able to figure out and eventually realize you've made some sort of mistake and have to start over. That's the whole point, really. But for some people it will feel like your time was wasted or disrespected. My first run, I lost my crown very early on and had to start over. That was fine and even kind of amusing. My second run was less than an hour. I got to the second island and didn't have any money or people with me and had to start over. That didn't bother me because it was early enough and it was a valuable learning experience; I understood how to avoid that happening next time.
4-5 hours into my third run and I'm kind of dreading starting the game up because I think I need to start over again because one of the things you can do, I didn't know you could do, and I think too many days have gone by and too many enemies spawn from each wave now that it's impossible for me to do that thing. I may be wrong, but I think that's the case.
So, I need to throw away the 5 hours I just spent here - 5 hours of playtime where I thought I was doing an amazing job and was preparing myself to be very comfortable - then spend another 5 hours just to get to where I am now, but hopefully in a much better position next time. Some find this addictive. I don't like that if I didn't make all the right choices, there's no way for me to fix things if I've gone too long. How many times do I need to face the realization that the last 5 hours of my life were wasted and I need to try again, not knowing if I'll actually get through the game next time?

Others recommend watching videos. I can only cautiously recommend that you watch them. The top YT result gave spoilers. Looking at thumbnails for videos even give spoilers, like showing a mount you didn't know about. If you don't want your sense of discovery robbed from you, you have to stay in the dark, but is it then going to be fun if you're stuck and wanted some guidance from a video? Well, you don't need to stay in the dark, but you'll have to be careful about how and where you seek information.
I more-or-less understand something I did wrong in my current run, but I still don't really know how to effectively prevent myself from ending up in this position again. And after scrapping a few runs, I don't ever want to face a point where that happens. Having to start from the absolute beginning after 5 hours is frustrating to me. What if I were 10 hours in? Maybe that will be the case on my fourth run.
It's not that I am against going in blind and having to learn the hard way and all that - I play some FromSoftware games and that's how you get through them - it's the starting from the beginning each time that is rough.

Each person is different when it comes to how they will feel about spoilers, having to start over, and whatever other complaints I may have and may find, so I don't really want to say anything too specific about my situation and I won't try to give strong advice because it may not be the best for the person reading, and also I'm obviously way too new to have a lot of advice to give.

The game doesn't hold your hand. I'm largely okay with this and think many will find that to be an appealing quality. I am fine with this concept. However, in other games, not holding your hand doesn't always mean wiping a save file with hours of progress and doing absolutely everything all over again. I won't say that this is a very difficult game and don't want to scare away people who may enjoy it, but some may find themselves feeling as I do and I want to make it clear that, as charming and relaxing as this game can be, there is a potential for real frustration, and there isn't a guarantee that you'll have learned enough to make your next run better.
For those who have learned how everything works and have completed the game, I imagine they might find this to be a super easy game. The difficulty is just in the learning.

So far, I enjoy this game. As much as I dread starting it up after I post this review, I'm also looking forward to it. But if my fourth run hits the same roadblocks after 5 hours, am I going to be as enthusiastic about a fifth? Maybe, but it's impossible for me to say now.
If this game interests you, I recommend buying it. I just got it on sale for $4. If you're on the fence, you could just play for a while and refund it if you realize it's not for you. It's currently part of a free weekend and I purchased it fairly quickly after trying it.
Overall, I think I may consider this as a great game, even though my knowledge and experience with it is very limited, and I'm experiencing a fair amount of frustration and remorse.

"In terms of new content, there’s a new soundtrack, and some new visuals, but largely the same from the previous Kingdom games. There’s a new limited gem resource, which is used to unlock statue upgrades, hermits, and mounts; but it feels like a redundancy more than anything and a bad attempt at adding variety to the game. There are also the challenge islands, and as the name suggests, are extra challenges for the players to overcome. However, there’s not that much beyond one main mechanic that you have to work around, and will mostly be the same gameplay as the main game.

One of the things that was done well are the. free DLCs. . This is a very good game and a very bad game at the same time. I like it, but I would never recommend it to anyone else. The mechanics are fun and simple, but the main challenge of the game is managing the idiotic AI to keep it from getting you killed. Builders would stand around while walls remained unbuilt. Archers would aggro enemies far from the walls no reason instead of hunting and making money. If you can get used to all of the idiosyncrasies it's fun, but occasionally you just end up gobsmacked by a confusing, out-of-nowhere AI decision and you just have to watch as everything falls apart. Then you rebuild.

I would be more forgiving if this wasn't the 3rd game in a very similar series, so they've had a lot of time and feedback to really get this AI working more sensibly. They have just refused to allow the smallest ability to rein in your AI villagers. Heck, even just a deconstruct/undo construction feature would make it so one bad choice or one accidental input won't ruin your run. Buuuut I guess they just haven't figured out how to make the game challenging otherwise.




Conclusion:
The game concept is simple but the simple things are often the most poorly executed. A lot of aspects are unpolished, many mechanics contradict each other, random generation can doom you before the game even starts.


EDIT: Almost two years have gone by since release and they are still more focused on new content then actually making the game playable. The free updates they released are just as buggy as the main game with unique issues thanks to the art and mechanical changes.

How come this pile of garbage have DLCs and folks are buying such crap is beyond my comprehension. Even there is nothing to look at as this game looks like someones PUKE!

I dig some Amiga vibes and decent low res graphics in games for nostalgia. But not anything like this puke here! It is insane for me to make on purpose a graphic design that look like Commodore 64 era ""graphics""
Back then it was okay as computing power was miniscule. 

Nowadays even potato PC can handle 3D graphics. What is the point in making such archaic graphics that literally it is pain to distinguish anything. I mean after about 20 min into experience with this garbage I realized that this person on the horse was probably a female! And the horse somehow look like dead horse or zombie horse.... WTF?! This is the level of this puke graphics! Pain to watch and try to recongize what the F^^^ is on my screen!

Literally pain to eyes and brain cells!
And ""gameplay"" is so damn generic, so boring, so basic that I can hardly call this thing a gameplay! Experiencing this thing for 60+ min was a waste of my time and each minute felt like torture. My thoughts were ""what am I doing?"" ""I am wasting my time!"" ""Stop it!""

And just now I took a look see at Steam reviews and realised that 21k+ people  like this garbage! It is like 90% positive reviews... Nowadays it is enough to make a pile of garbage and earn money from it... What a weird times.
I feel like if I would start to learn how to make a game and would spent 6 or even 12 months i would create proper game compared to this puke puddle.

I must now reanimate at least some of my brain cells that were slowly dying while playing this pile of squared crapp by playing some proper games.

I cannot deal with that and don't know how long I would need to wait or what to do to reach the bronze age. I've tried, but fucksake.

"Very simple and fun side scroll RTS, if you like a casual RTS game that can be played almost on every platform, this is the perfect game for you. I advise the new comers to research first, since this game only covers the pretty basic information, but does not cover most of the critical ones or label them. I think it's part of the exploration/survival feel to it. But it will help a lot on your first play through, if you research a bit before diving in.

"+ charming visuals and audio
+ very relaxing, simple controlls
+ split screen support
+ beautiful in its simplicity, lovely shows how to do stuff and allows you to figure them out yourself instead of telling you.

- repetetive and doesn't respect your time.
- deaths can happen extremly fast out of nowhere even if you have money on you.
- hauling gold from farms to bank is boring but you have to do it if you want to have any savings
- you need to use friendly NPCs to max level buildings. They can get kidnapped and be gone for a very long time.
- doesn't explain some critical information that are very hard to findout about otherwise.
- Its not a good rougelike, every run is the same as there is no RNG or skill involved in rebuilding what was destroyed. Its just ment to waste your time.
- I didn't have enough time to play through all campaign variations, but reading the wiki they are the same game with very minor mechanical changes like shogun has just ninjas instead of pikeman, thats it everything else is the same besides new visuals, this should have been an option in the menu not a new campaign.

I would love to give a positive review as I did enjoy it at the start, but im not going back to this I am not going to rebuild every island for the 4th time, because some frog in split second took my crown when I still had gold on me.",False,1728873098
"Kingdom Two Crowns 🏰👑 is a standout in the minimalist strategy genre, captivating players with its stunning 2D pixel art and immersive atmosphere that offers depth and challenge despite its simple appearance. If you want a game that encourages thoughtful decision-making without overwhelming complexity, this is an excellent choice.

Positive Aspects 🌟!!!
· Immersive Aesthetic and Atmosphere 🎨:
The enchanting visual style features picturesque landscapes and dynamic lighting that change with the day-night cycle, creating a vibrant world. The ambient soundtrack enhances the relaxing yet eerie atmosphere.

· Simple Yet Strategic Gameplay ⚔️:
Easy to learn but challenging to master, the game allows players to build and defend their kingdom through straightforward mechanics like collecting coins and hiring subjects. Success hinges on careful planning and efficient resource management.

· Cooperative Mode 👥:
The cooperative mode lets you play with a friend, either locally or online, adding a strategic layer where players must work together to expand and defend against the relentless hordes of Greed.

· Progression and Exploration 🌍:
As you progress, you can explore new islands with unique challenges. The game keeps players engaged by balancing kingdom expansion with new threats and hidden secrets to enhance defenses.

· Constant Challenge 🛡️:
The relentless hordes of Greed create an ongoing sense of urgency, requiring players to balance expansion and defense while managing the pressure from the day-night cycle and enemy waves.",True,1728871981

"It's a mixed bag. The visuals are beautiful and the music is pretty chill but there are too many annoyances that drain the fun; eventually it all becomes a drag. For example:
- Your player character moves too slow. You walk at a snail's pace and the mount needs time to rest after running. That's not fun. 
- The hermit NPCs that you need to upgrade buildings go missing sometimes and never come back. Dumb friendly AI that you need to babysit is not fun.
- How much gold you can cary is very limited. So eventually you end up wasting it because your gold bag is full and people just keep throwing gold at you when you can't carry it. So you need to keep dropping the gold at the same rate as they are giving it to you. That's annoying. Why is there no way to upgrade your bag size or have multiple bags?
- You have to rebuild the ship on each island. That's not fun. Once is enough.
- When you leave one island in perfect condition and come back to it later, it's not in the same condition. Feels like game is forcing you to lose progress which is not fun. 
- Too much micromanagement needed but everything is too slow because people have to walk all the way across the map which is very wide.
- A random boar encounter can really derail your game if you are in early stages of setting up your city.
- Hoarding gold is not fun. But the game forces you to do it because the next island is harder and also the winter season doesn't provide as many resources. So you need to reserve gold for later.
- Having to repeatedly go back and forth between gold farmers and the castle/bank is not fun.
- For some reason the game does not let you mark more than 4-5 trees to be chopped down at a time. Why not let us select all the trees we want? Leave it to the player if the trees should all be chopped down in one go or in batches.
- There is no way to cancel or pause the construction of something. If you have only a few builders and you start building something on one side of the map but there is something that needs urgent builder's attention on the other side of the map (because the horde damaged it badly for instance) then you have to wait for builders to finish all the already queued up items before they slowly walk to the other side that needs their attention.

The game is wasting too much time on the frustrating monotonous stuff instead of focusing on the fun aspects like building, upgrading, and defending the city. The more you play the more tedious and repetitive it becomes. You end up spending more time ""running"" around the map collecting resources instead of actually building or defending.

At first the game is addicting. The art and the lore is cool. Building and exploring is initially fun. But once you learn all the rules, it starts feeling like a chore.

Overall I'm leaning towards not recommended. If the above issues don't sound too bad to you then you might enjoy it for a number of hours.",False,1728869351

"Defeat is the experience of starting anew.
No thanks...

I'm editing my review to provide context.

What I liked:
The game looks beautiful. The pixel art is detailed and smooth.

The ambience and soundtrack are spot on. It's very relaxing and pleasant to play.

The game loop is extremely addictive. 

What I didn't like:

I don't mind not knowing how everything works from the start but it's silly not to have a description that says you need to find stone, or what the fella you pick up on your horse for one coin does, for example. 


It's a trial and error business.
Do a few misteps and you are trapped on an island without coins or enough archers to protect your settlement. It's game over.

You have to rebuild your ship every single time you travel to an island. Why?
Why does it get destroyed?

You are travelling to other islands to get resources.
You must make a setllement on each one because you have to rebuild the ship every time, even if the island you just arrived at has only a few diamonds to collect and nothing else.

The game does have some difficulty spikes. Sometines it feels like it's not giving you a fair chance.

Overall it's a very well made game and most people will enjoy for a few hours and some much longer than that.

For me it's one of those games where you sink away your time but don't feel like you really did anything once you stop.

I do recommend it on a good sale like the one it's on now to be fair but I wouldn't be happy getting it full price.",False,1728816345

"I am a huge Kingdom fun. And I would love to give it a 5 stars but I can't. 
That understand me wrong. I admire the dedication and love put into this DLC. It has an amazing vibe, aesthetics, new mechanics, but many things are not right, including bugs, and it makes the gameplay much worsened. 

Let me explain in some details:
* Chimera mount is OP. Literally it's not worth to invest in other mounts. You can destroy most of the armies, even blood moon armies (hard mode) just with this mount. If you combine that with a shield, or staff. You are invincible. Mounts are super unbalanced IMO. 
* Game is too easy and again unbalanced (hard mode). New mechanics allows you to take many more people to next islands, which is seems as a good change, but difficulty seems like it wasn't adjusted. In previous games I had to plan my trips, and seasons. Now I can move to the new island anytime I like, because it makes no difference. 

Potential bugs:
* on Mac very often game starts with a black screen, and I had to restart
* One winter ended as planned, had 3-4 days of spring and winter hit again, restarting the season cycle. So, except these 3-4 days of Spring, my Winter season lasted >30 days. Insane. Still, it was fairly easy thanks to bushes and fishing. 
* On the last Island I wasn't attacked until I started to attack snake. Is that a bug? Otherwise is super easy, because I can build up everything without being disturbed. 
* After finishing the game, some things start to glitch. My army tried to attack a destroyed portal. Builders did not want to cut down threes, or build on destroyed portals. 
* People moving backwards. 
* A lot of glitches of sprites that should disappear but did not. Like tutorial sprites, destroyed portal was presented as a new one, etc. 

To be fair, some changes I love:
* Choosing different islands, with different rewards
* Possibility to buy back the dog and hermits 
* Hoplites! And ability to attack portals without knights
* Ships!

"Do not buy this game. It is not good for you. It is poorly optimized and is basically one of those board-game style RTS games like Horde games but in real time and even more boring.  This game will make you worse in every way. The whole Kingdom franchise is awful, dull time-waste.

Too much busywork, too slow and you have no control over what the AI units do to the points. The only way I could comfortably play the game was to cheat infinite gold that cut down the worst tedium by about 70 %.

The game is terrible when you have to cheat to make it feasible. Without cheating the enemies would simply get overrun because it takes a lot of gold to get the basic defenses up and the gold generation early on is terrible. In practice, if the enemy spawns the big enemies while you are still starting (even on Easy), you are screwed because without the relative late catapult upgrades and a lot of pikemen - all these are late game upgrade units - your game is over.

This game design feels unfinished. It is more tistic frustration than fun. I beat the campaign once just to test things and it was not fun. The game kills you too easily when you play legit and there are no benefits in dying despite the game working like a roguelite - this is a sign of bad, difficulty-padded design when you don't give the player anything even when it crushes the player with impossible odds early on if the RNG says so.

The game is super cryptic. There are no building names or any descriptions or documents. It is a problem because things are not obvious. For example, to build a particular structure such as the bakery, you need to upgrade your tower (that look on your face - bakery from a tower - it is as stupid and defense-nerfing in game as it sounds like) and then find a particularly-colored hermit and then painstakingly bring that hermit to the tower so that it can allow you to upgrade that bakery building. If this sounds too much for you, this game definitely is too much for you. It clearly was too much for me and I technically beat it.

I have no clue how to beat it legit. You have to hope that the AI does not mess up and train wrong units. For example, AI favors training pikemen that cannot take any enemy objectives and make you stuck because of not enough actually useful units.

The core gameplay loop is a massive time waste. I have played Classic, New Lands and now Two Crowns. Original had only one level and no cave fights AFAIK, New Lands added multi-island sailing thing and Two Crowns added the super tedious cave fights.",False,1728790607

"I know there are a million reviews on Steam that wish for a 'neutral' option so here's another one for the slush pile. I honestly think this is a good game but the lack of a tutorial or any substantive in-game hints make the trial and error aspect of the gameplay a slog at times. Most of the time, to be honest. It doesn't even warn you that it's a rogue-like. On my first attempt I think I'd reached the third, possibly the fourth island when one of those Purple Meanies (Greedlings?) knocked off my crown and ran away through a portal. Oh, I thought, that was odd. Then a message flashed up on the screen. Then I found out that having the crown nicked was a fail state. Then I found out you get kicked back to the very first island. Yep, all those reassuring 'Saving Game' notices are virtually meaningless. Almost uninstalled.

I did persevere and was grateful that some of your progress is preserved in terms of buildings and gold stored in coffers but none of this is explained in the game. I'm old enough to remember the days of PC games coming on floppy disks in big cardboard boxes. If KIngdom Two Crowns had arrived that way you'd think someone at the game store had pinched the manual. You get a few 'Stand Here & Press This Key' hints and that's it. I made swords the other day. I was quite proud of myself. All my villagers completely ignore them, unlike the other weapons I make. Who uses swords? No idea.

Another example, on a rare occasion that I had enough gems to unlock something, I spent them on a strange looking hut. A little old lady wandered out and jumped on the back of my horse. Is she a witch? A cursed princess? No idea. At the risk of a pattern forming, she jumped off my horse to get a drink just as the Purple Meanies were attacking. I ran away and she was scooped up and, yes dear reader, carried through the portal. Sorry, granny, whoever you were.

Maybe this game is fun if you play it on one device whilst looking for instructions on another, but that's not how I like to play games. Trial and error is one thing but I felt like Sideshow Bob stepping on a bunch of rakes.",False,1728774025

In my part, I tried looking up info online after my first run completely stalled. In my second run, everything was going great until I accidentally went to a new island during Winter, and had no way of surviving and just had to slowly watch my small camp wither away until I lost. I do really enjoy the game, though my latest loss definitely put me off of the game for now. I think I will return, but for now I like the game but have had enough of it",True,1728771408

"I would like nothing more than to recommend this game. The idea is great, the gameplay is addictive, and the graphics are really striking.

But for a game that old, it's absolutely, completely, riddled with bugs. I'm not only talking about the new DLC (though it is bugged, especially the last act that's mostly unplayable, especially in coop : we had to reset the game 13 times in the last hour to get to the end boss, which was also bugged !).

"This is not my type of game. 
it has amazing graphics, and cool musics, but made my pc lag.
it is also super addictive, but super boring at the same time, because
in the begining it is really fun to get resourses and expand your vilage, but after some hours, it gets really boring, because it is always: get money from the farms, buy builders, expand, repeat. 
The character walks very slowly, even when running, and, when running, you get tired fast, so you move slowly the majority of the time. (even more if the game is laging all the time, in my case, it got really annoying)
And when you get at the end of the exploration, you are obligated to start all over again.
But, i recognize that it is my personal vision, and other people can find it really fun. and i played the game for free, so i would recomend the game if it is your tipe of game.
anyways, even if i liked it, i would uninstall it because it is addictive to me, and addictive games are really distracting when i am trying to study.

Watch the gameplay trailer, if I tried to describe it, I would be ruining the point in the game. You are very much supposed to figure stuff out on your own and not look at guides or ask for help, I promise it's not that difficult to figure out.

"Fury Studios built on their previous standalones games. I didn't try 'em cuz it seemed to me a lil simple. Like not much to do. But after playing with a friend, getting accustomed with mechanics, I jumped on it and can now safely say : imho this is the perfect title to get. Even with no DLCs there's plenty of content !!

It must be said, the pixel art is gorgeous, soundtrack peculiar and smooth, and both come generously in the game. The mood while playing is astounding. You marvel at quality and subtle daylight tones, nature hues while time passes through cycles and seasons. The attention to detail so invites to a contemplation.. and with a minimal interface it builds more to the atmosphere.

You'll get to play a Campaign, with several settlements ; and yet five Challenge Islands, with a particular mechanic affecting the game. All comes in 3 playable ""modes"" as Classic (european), Shogun, and Dead Lands (fantasy-ish). Each is a full reskin, with minimal change to mechanics : trees sizes/density, one unit vary by function, siege engines, but more extensively different ermits - specialized buildings, and mounts with different feats and powers. 
DLCs add up to the count of these 'setting' modes, with more variation than vanilla ones.

So yeah simple mechanics but quite a lotta stuff to try and play. Learning them & the pace of the game, when to expand or develop economy, is delightful and engaging. As the scenery is beautiful, there's quite the ticking of the clock here.. Game can be harsh to a wrong move, but not really punishing death : its all about the enemy getting stronger and the lategame. 
Difficulty can adjust that, Hard is as such, and Cursed well its no joke. I may have just one win on Cursed.

All of this, can be played freely co-op, locally or not. With the ever-present river mirroring the surface, the game actually looks surprisingly good in split screen..
All right Imma stop here. Get it, play with friends or enjoy it alone, and don't mind the DLCs you'll have a couple hundreds hours of maps to try and plenty wonders to gaze at.",True,1728753617

"This game has a nice gameplay, however it's also extremely frustrating, to the point where I find it absurd to spend time on it honestly. Unless the following features are added to it, it's unplayable, and I do not recommend it:
1. Map: You have no idea where enemies are, where your builders and archers are, or where you should go to. Everything is a random guess. Because of this idiotic ""map-less"" design of the game, I couldn't find a proper settlement and instead head right into the enemies. I ended up with 0 coins and couldn't do anything, it was game over! It's like punishing the player because of the randomness of the game itself.
2. Canceling a builder assignment: Once you give a command, it's done. It's final. No take backs.
3. Fighting chance to the hero: Consider the case I found myself in, in No. 1. What the hell should I do? Either give the hero a fighting chance, or a ""pain stakingly"" slow coin generating ability as a default action.
4. Save/Load or Checkpoints: There's no save, load, or checkpoints. All actions and events are final. Like wtf? Save and load should be basic functions in a ""strategy""-ish game. You're taking away the essence of ""experimenting and finding out"" out of the whole genre.
5. Population & Resource management: I ended up with 16 builders, whereas I had no idea I had this many. There's no resource management feature, none. You have to guess how many people you have, how much coin you ""might"" generate, and what each of the buildings or people do.

For your kingdom, there's absolutely no overview , control, prediction, or high-level management involved. It's just doing a frustrating ping-pong across an endless map-less environment, collecting stuff, until you quite randomly come across an unpredictable event that'll without any warning transport you to the next level.

Again, it does have chill vibes, and if the above issues are OK with you, then by all means enjoy it! But it's a definite no go from me.",False,1728751678

"edit/update: Changing to recommend because atmosphere and value are great and alone worth trying but still on the fence about design. The developer says the game is meant to be relaxing, if that's what you're looking for then definitely play on peaceful mode, the lack of information makes the defense side of the game frustrating IMO.

Original review:
I wanted to like this game but it ended up being far too frustrating and tedious to be fun. Graphics, sound and music were all fantastic, but the minimalist design tries to be to clever for its own good and gets in the way of the game. 

I played the campaign on normal difficulty, made it to the third island where I decided it just wasn't fun enough for me to keep playing.

I had a long paragraph about what didn't work but this quote from the community wiki illustrates the issues around information well: ""For more than two years since the game release, the community tried, without success, to understand the purpose of upgrading the lighthouse. Finally on May 2021 the developer Alan Kertz shares a relevant chunck of information..."". The answer was simple and would fit in a tooltip but you can't have that because ""minimalism"".

Pros:
* Aesthetics: graphics are beautiful, music is great
 * Minimalism where it works well: visual indicators for basics are good. Your mount does a good job of showing its exhaustion. Construction progress, crop growth, (some) portal damage, etc. are all very clear.

Cons:
* very little information on what things, buildings and units actually do
* you have to taxi certain characters (hermits) around with you to upgrade buildings (tedious), yet you aren't allowed to move the people you actually do want to position like archers, squads, pike men (frustrating).
* Minimalism where it fails: really not obvious what different buildings do, what upgrading them does, you have to just watch them and guess. Depending on surroundings some buildings/upgrades can do absolutely nothing.

Personal gripe:
* On the first island, you have repair a ship by putting in 10 coins, then 2 more, then 8(?) more to go on the ship to the next island as the means of story(?) progression, which is simple enough to stumble upon since there's visual indication of progress at each step and not much you can do on the first island.
* On the second island, repairing the ship the same way doesn't work, you put in 10 coins and see progress and then it asks for 2, you give it 2 and a log falls from the ship(?) and nothing changes on the ship, weird, it asks for 2 more coins, you try again and the same thing, you try maybe 5, 10, 20 times and the same thing happens so you think to yourself: I guess I can't be repair it this time and I have to kill a portal or something else to progress, or maybe it's bugged or I've soft-locked myself. Well no, your mistake was stopping at 20 and not 59. Very strange that there's no indication of it being repaired, especially considering the first ship had a very clear piece by piece building animation, why not re-use it? each time you put in 2 coins, increment the animation?

1. Random disconnection with the another person hosting under the same network. Just give us the option to play over LAN, is that asking for too much?

2. Armies that are inside the boat, hopping out just after setting sail. So when you pick your next island, they will not follow you.

3. Greeds such as breeders not catching fire when they are exposed to it.

4. Shield stations not populating, when they do, more than 1 of them will stacked on top of another.

5. Ghost army weapon is practically useless now. The knight just stands there and doesn't attack unless they get bumped. The archers will not follow me to a portal, they just sit there until something is in range. Wouldn't even attack the portals unless a greed is coming through it.

6. When trying to set a blaze incoming greed from the beach portal, the fire will not appear.

7. Playing it on the steam deck isn't very stable either. Stuttering issues occur randomly, ruining the pixel animation and gaming experience.

"The latest expansion ""Call of Olympus"" brings many welcome changes. 

For one there are gem chests, sometimes even multiple on every island, including the first so you're not starved for gems and can happily unlock every mount and most of the hermits on your first arrival/playthrough of the island. 

Secondly every island ONLY has small portals, so you can completely clear the greed out on every island with the new boat mechanic and/or your knights, so that's a nice objective for each island.

Thirdly islands are no longer linear, you get a map where you can select from four small islands and then each leads to a bigger island for a total of 8, not including the final island, so you're free to pursue the islands in whichever order you wish.

Forth: Each island has a side quest, the small islands have you repair a specific god's temple, and then the big islands feature a god side quest that leaves you with an artifact that has a special ability.

Fifth: The spirit guide, one coin and you get advice on where to go or what to do next, so you're never guessing.


All really good changes that guide you rather than hoping you figure it out, which also making each island matter. You can fully complete each island (that being completing the quest, and defeating the greed on both sides) so you have a goal on EACH island.
The boat mechanic makes good use of the water (finally) and enables you to have more soldiers when you go to defeat the greed. You feel less like a survivor constantly running away and more like a military hero bringing peace to the lands. Lastly I love the abundance of gems so you don't have to make strict choices, you're free to explore mounts & hermits.

"This game has a learning curve when you first get started and there are times when it is tense and difficult. Eventually, as you learn how to play and understand what's going on, the game will get easier. 

It is good and fun and all, but after ~25 hours, I got bored of the primary gameplay loop. Thing is, these 25 hours happened fairly quickly so it wasn't just getting bored but also burned out. 

You can get the game for 80% off, at $4 at time of writing and I do recommend it for that price. 

At this point, I'd start rambling on about the gameplay, but the experience as you go through the discovery methods to learn the game is important - at least in my opinion, so I'll cut it short here. Go and explore and have fun!",True,1728582316

"This game is a captivating and addictive example of how minimalism and simplicity can be interwoven with complex elements placed in just the right spot. Kingdom Two Crowns is a game of empire and resource management, conquest and bespoke gameplay. You establish bases on progressively more difficult islands, growing in size and power to unlock more and more tools and resources. There are numerous mounts, artifacts and units spread out over the various expansions to find just the right style for you. Using only 5 buttons, you will expand your empire and combat the increasingly difficult greed.

CONS: 
There are a few downsides to these games, that if you are aware of at the beginning can be bypassed easily. The biggest one is just the AI of the units. It is very difficult to orchestrate certain behaviours using the system, such as prioritizing lot clearing/when to run/where to stand. Tree lots can only be cleared from the outermost trees, and workers often prioritize trees that make it difficult to quickly queue more clearing. Soldier squads don't always cluster at the outermost point of the walls, making their ranged weapons useless in night defense. Projects once assigned, can't be cancelled either, so if you accidentally queue up work outside your base at the wrong time - workers will likely try to travel out during the waves, or will NOT travel automatically when the path has been cleared. I find it difficult to reconcile some of the wave triggers as well, as they don't always make sense timing wise. Second, is the base building and where they appear. As you expand and upgrade, you unlock new buildings whose placement is not always sensible. Between forests, environmental assets, placement of puzzles and ""side elements"" such as mounts, there is just a lot of inconsistency with where you might find certain buildings you really want. Third is just the sheer number of mounts with various but limited utility; and artifacts as well in some of the later expansions. Perhaps my playstyle is just not conducive with them, but there seems to be just a large amount of superfluous abilities with balancing issues. The bear, for example, has offensive capabilities but limited stamina. It doesn't seem worthwhile when it's primary use is ""hunting."" The warhorse can trigger limited invulnerability, but again the retreat pacing and offensive units AI, doesn't really align in a meaningful way. There are multiple NPCs you can rescue for specific upgrades, but they aren't always useful. The baker and the knight captain have the greatest impact, being able to lure peasants to the base, and recruit additional knights. The base defense builder is limitedly useful - you can't really access their talents early enough to be highly impactful, but you can see some utility with them. The ""horn"" maker makes little sense, as waves are split to both sides of your kingdom, and summoning all units to one side can just take way too long. There should really be a mechanic for once a ""lane"" is fully cleared of portals, all units from that side go to the other and stay there. The ""rancher"" is also annoying because once you find a mount that suits your style, you're not likely to change them frequently, so having all your acquired mounts in one place is a waste of gold. The last issue - which is just a personal grievance - is the limited offensive capability of the player. There are a handful of mounts, and some artifacts in later expansions, that allow some combat potential, but you still feel largely impotent when faced with waves. This is likely the intent, but I would love to be more of a frontline leader.

PROS:
There are just too many pros to count. I absolutely adore just how charming the game feels. I love the expansiveness of the maps. I revel in the feeling of superiority you get when you've mastered base set-up and strategy. I have these moments when I just crave this game, and get lost in it for hours. Each run feels unique, even while being very similar. Each victory feels sublime, and being able to bring units from island to island makes traversal worthwhile. I get chills every time I send a squad of knights/samurai/etc. to take out a portal. For such a seemingly basic game with minimal controls, the experience and difficulty curve make for a truly incredible game. Challenge islands offer a new level of test when you need a break from the base game.

EXPANSIONS:
There are a ton of added DLC bits. There are 4 other grand campaigns - Japanese, Norse, Fantasy, and Greek - each with new aesthetics and new gameplay mechanics. Some have artifacts that add a new level of fun, but they meld seamlessly into the base mechanics. You won't feel lost while you come to terms with the new elements. I would say the Norse one is the most fun, from driving a chariot pulled by Lynx while wielding Mjolnir and calling down lightning on your foes, to solving different puzzles and turning your workers into twin-axe berserkers to RUIN waves of Greed. I would also say the Greek one is probably the most accessible expansion, while being the most removed from the base game. I REALLY loved the ability to lead your own warband with naval support, and the removal of the whole ""big bomb"" element to fully close portals. The Dead Lands was probably my least favorite, but I highly appreciate what they did with it and how it works with the new characters and abilities. It also has a wierdly Bloodborne aesthetic, which I admit makes me really happy. The Japanese one is probably the closest in form to the base - with the addition of ninjas to help fish during the day, and camp outside the gates at night to defend. I would love to see more of what this team can do. I would love to see a slightly more ""modern"" version, maybe with guns/cannons/etc. I would love to continue the mechanics introduced by Olympus, from the warband leading, the naval support, the multiple ships that allow more and more units to be brought with you from island to island, and the fun puzzling.

Ultimately this game is such a diamond in a sea of reskins and knockoffs. I cannot speak highly enough about this game, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy but addictive game with decent challenge. I would also LOVE to give Coop a try!",True,1728580862

"Today i change my review after trying multiplayer.
Jesus this game f**** sucks to do something so basic.

I played for many hours solo. Completed every campaign, trying online multiplayer just made me HATE this game.

Multiplayer friends list doesn't work, inviting someone through steam is the only way but disconnects happen more frequently than they should and the player invited gets loaded in the campaign alone just taking away time.

It is a hassle to play multiplayer. Only local play (split screen) makes you able to enjoy someone's company without any trouble.

"- Probably the fifth big DLC and it's still awfully grindy ( they could have tweaked the game somehow by now. Especially when it's just a reskin )
- The island layout is still RNG. You can get an island that literally can't be played, you're softlocked and can't move because you have portals right at the base. You can't destroy those without units, you can't build those units without space, and you don't have that space.....because of portals. Catch 22. I can't believe they still haven't hired an proper coder for these problems.
- The soundtrack sounds a lot weaker to me than what Kalandra or Amos Rody did.
- I can't say that the DLC has any Mediterranean atmosphere.

This piece of art is incredible to say the least, it is the perfect co-up game to partner up with a buddy and explore the worlds vast lands, as you conquer new land and build up your empire (kingdom) with the currency you earn, as you continue to progress the game. 

Whilst some critics may be harsh on the games simplicity, I think it's actually one of the things this game has going for it. Sure it's a 2D left and right game, but just play 20 minutes of this game and you'll know it has so much more to offer.

From gathering coins/artefacts, to taming new creatures, to building up your defence, and upgrading your villagers. There is so much this game offers you to build up your Kingdom the way you want to.

"I think this is my favorite of the 3 Kingdom games, but I'm not sure.

Improvements/changes that are really appreciated : 

1) Vagrants run to your base when you recruit them now.
2) The builders' AI is much better. They are still often not as close to you as you'd want them to be, but they mostly don't kill themselves anymore by taking very stupid risks.
3) Farms seem to generate gold much more quickly
4) Permanent statues effects
5) Pikemen (they are good at defending the walls and they also fish)
6) Mounts added, changes to hermits, etc.

In summary, almost everything is better.

BUT, I'm not sold on the difficulty. I played the game on normal, but it was either too easy or literally impossible. I died once and that's when there was an impossible to surmount surge in difficulty after I ENTIRELY cleared Island #2 and went back to Island #4. That's because when you destroy portals and dock portals, future greed waves are permanently bigger in numbers and difficulty. So, it's much easier to just destroy the side with the cliff portal and ignore the side with the dock portal. That's not something the game tells you. Because of that, I started Island #4 and after 1 night I had lost pretty much everything. After that, I started on Island #1 again, then #4, etc. And the game was never hard after that.

Anyway. Now that I've beaten the base game, I have no reason to play the game through even if it's on a harder difficulty. It's not the same thing when you've already beaten a game. So even if I do, yes the game will be more difficult and maybe more challenging and interesting in a way, but it's also much less interesting at the same time because the game won't be new to me anymore and most of its mysteries are already revealed to me.",True,1728248515

"i did not expect to enjoy this game as much as i have been. my partner and i are playing local co-op, and it's been really fun. it's the sort of game that (intentionally) tells you very little about what you're supposed to be doing, but the ui is designed in a way that encourages you to press buttons to see what happens. it's also really good at providing feedback that teaches you what you just did. it feels like being 9 and buying an NES game at the pawn shop with no manual, and just figuring stuff out as you go.

the gameplay loop manages to keep the grind fun, feeding you a slow trickle of progress followed by moments where we shout ""ooohhhhh shiittttttt, look at this sick upgrade i just built!"" and inching you closer and closer to clearing an island.

a few years ago, we played through spiritfarer, and have continued looking for another game to scratch that itch -- light crafting/building, farming and resource management, and incremental progression. while these are obviously different games, they certainly have some threads in common.

The different games (e.g. norselands) sometimes add in a new mechanic, or sometimes are just a re-skin but I have enjoyed all of them and all are worth it. Once you get the hang of what you are supposed to be doing - there is a tiny bit of direction in the beginning - its so enjoyable.

It's mostly a chilled game, you are just focused on what you are doing, trying to be productive, efficient. There are different difficulty modes which I like because it changes the intensity and your play style. I think its pretty re playable too to see if you can complete it better and collect everything if you didn't get it the first time around (I definitely did not).

Even moving them one to the right as IJKL would be better than the buttons chosen).

Additionally, choosing what character model to play should just be a pop-up in game, rather than needing to spam the down button to choose the model, and then having to rely on random chance if you're doing multiplayer to give you the one you'd prefer playing as.

As-is, the game is a 7 or 8 out of 10, if the devs are willing to and ever put out any quality of life changes, then it'd be at least an 8 if not a 9 out of 10 for me.",True,1726452255

I tried looking for a good Steam guide for this game in English but none of them were what I was looking for, so I might make one of my own in the near future.

"Kingdom Two Crowns is a charming mix of strategy and chaos that starts off easy but quickly turns into a frantic quest for survival. Your horse, bless its heart, has the stamina of a caffeinated squirrel, always running out of energy just when you need it most.

They’re absolute legends, bringing in so much gold you might as well start your own mint.

"This game suffers from a repetitive, badly paced, and painfully slow gameplay loop. Possibly the worst design element of the game is how long movement takes, as you're constantly riding back and forth across your city just waiting to get from one place to the other, with only repetitive walls as the backdrop. They also don't iterate on the core loop at all, so you're stuck redoing all of your actions on every island you go to, which gets old incredibly fast. What also seems like a really poor decision is making you, the player, a character in the world, but yet not giving you a real chance to participate in combat (before getting certain  mounts with combat abilities, which again are PAINFULLY slow). I'm honestly really surprised how this game has such positive reviews, but maybe that's simply because so many more recent games do similar things better. Thronefall takes inspiration from the economy/building system of Kingdom, but makes for a tighter, action packed game loop that is thoroughly satisfying, and levels differ enough to keep the game feeling fresh. Dome keeper has a similar element to waves of enemies attacking you from two sides in timed intervals, but again, has a much faster gameplay loop and incredibly well constructed fighting mechanics. 

TLDR: Slow and repetitive gameplay loop. Get a fresher game like Thronefall to have a similar experience but devoid of painful periods of crawling across your town with your horse at snail speed.",False,1725099457

Also, the game itself is buggy and has very poor options menu: you can't even change the controls. Also, some achievements require you to buy some stupid DLC, which I condemn very much. The game has a poorly balanced difficulty: your character is immortal if you play in cooperative, but at the same time the game is quite difficult if you play alone.",False,1723738386
"This game is relatively fun and calming. Patience and learning are all part of this game, the art and music both feel amazing, especially with their respective DLC. The increasing difficulty of the game may feel overwhelming however I do believe it is the point of the game to lose many times. There is an heir feature that makes you feel less punished when you lose with a 4 half-statement tutorial. Multiplayer makes the game not only fun but significantly easier. Every map is slightly different with each playthrough giving someone to explore every time you play. The challenge islands are okay, hit or miss. Skull and Plague are relatively fun in my opinion, and the others like Dire and Trade are just okay, won't give it more than 17 tries; Lost  Island feels like Kingdom New Lands which was the previous installment, and luck dependant. Like holy, I only beat that game when Lady Luck blessed me with an archer statue. 
The bad parts in my opinion are repetitiveness and winter. To defeat an island, you send out your units to attack the portal and when the time is right, you send in the bomb. For all cliff portals (DLC included), it feels extremely easy and repetitive. The only thing difficult about it is making it to the exit on time. In the winter part, a massive shift between, running out there and getting a pouch full of gold is gone although, you do have farmers harvest berries, which is a good feature to generate some gold to sustain yourself. I treat winter like fighting the Russians, and we all know what happens when we do that. Shogun DLC is mostly a reskin, though be it ninjas replace the Pikemen which is an amazing swap. Norse and Dead Lands DLC are amazing with player abilities tagging alongside mount abilities.  By the end of the day, it is a relatively good game to kill time or play with someone but you have to put in the effort of learning how to play the game and have patience for you will be waiting a very long time.",True,1723690044

"I like this game, and it's extremely polished, well designed, beautiful pixels, and soundtrack. But if you are making a simplified RTS/Simulation game, the AI better be able to figure things out.
(Not going into detail on the positives, other reviews do that)


3 things to simplify my issues
- the game is extremely tedious, and doesn't really do anything to make it fun or exciting in those tedious moments
- Zero unit control: Can't reassign jobs, reposition defense units, units ignore towers, squires don't defend until all walls are gone, units don't react to enemies near main base
- Very easy to get into a suicide is your only option: Hero can't defend/attack aka useless and slow, ^ alot of the issues in #2 lead up to this, mistakes made are only realized when it's too late, Huge difficulty spikes when you get to island 3, not able to recover stolen tools/weapons, no alternative way to get diamonds/gems (That i found so far)


-------------Rant below--------------

The third island just spiked in difficulty by like 10 times, and all those lack of AI / ordering unit controls I've been wanting just is amplified by 10 times as well.

My left side got wiped out by the blood moon, then for some reason, the next night i got a second huge blood moon(wasn't a blood moon but it had the exact same enemies as the previous night) wave. (2 Siegers, 20 + minion things, and 4 - 5 flyers)

And for some dumb reason, the 20 units I have are just camping on the right side, even though nothing is attacking from that side. Even though the units broke through the wall right in front of the castle. You think they would want to defend that. Or there were would be some alarm i could ring for a last defense. Nope... Just have to wait for these units to blow up EVERY SINGLE Wall to get to the VERY LAST Wall that my units are camped at. I don't understand how such an obvious flaw, for a well designed game like this can be so missed. I immediately ran into the first time my units on one side lost an attack. because usually if you lose a defense most of the units die when they retreat. 

The other issue i have is, it's very easily to get STUCK in where the only option is suicide. I don't mean this happens frequently just that it's easy to get into this state. Island 3 has no tradesmen guy that just walks off and comes back and gives you 20coins so thats one income source you were use to early on just gone. So 3rd island you need archers to hunt. Well theres no rabbits near by for some reason. so the only gold source is cutting trees. Lol. until you get farmers. Well i didnt realize there were no rabbits until it was too late and so i had cut down the trees that i could and hadn't upgraded my base enough to get the scythes fast enough. and so i was just sitting there waiting for magical coins to spawn which doesn't happen so i died. This has been the result of my death twice, with the next upcoming third death, where i just stopped from the left defenses being destroyed and can't repair fast enough before the next night and get enough archers to defend. because I CANT REASSIGN my unit jobs or MOVE THE 30 units defending the right side to the left a bit. baffling and huge flaw in such a simple well thought out design.

Also not being able to recover the items the enemies steal is a bit disappointing and a huge hit to your economy. I can't defend my units because you can't attack.
Sometimes it just kinda feels like the whole game was designed to annoy you the moment you make a mistake, but you don't know you are making a mistake until it's too late.",False,1722965604

"I loved the other kingdom but this one has two issues for me:

1. It’s buggy and annoying. The tutorial ghost keeps popping up wanting me to « follow » for no reason, and then disappears for me reason. I tried to follow it but it just takes to random places and wants me to do actions from the tutorial but like I’m on day 30…. Not to mention the fact that every time I restart the campaign, I have to do the whole tutorial again. The skip tutorial button only shows up once in a while. And if I press it even if it’s not there, nothing happens, still have to do the tutorial 🤡 why is there no « disable tutorial » option in the menu? 

2. What the efffff is happening with the game progress? What are the different islands in the game? Why does the first island show me the option to upgrade to stone walls if I don’t have access to stone on this island? What is the goal? Just to fix the boat and get the next island asap? What are the witches in the cabin for? What is the power I have in the dead lands version for? Like I understand that they had to make some changes from the previous games (which were simpler) for novelty, but they add all these new layers and give us no explanation, and I just can’t figure out what this game wants or expects from me. Found out that when I go to the next island, the enemies that spawn seem to be way stronger in the first wave compared to the past island, which I guess is fine if I knew to expect that but I didn’t and everyone died. Start again I guess. Do the tutorial again for the tenth time. 

Kind of ridiculous that I’ve sinked like hundred of hours in the previous kingdom games but this one just frustrates me and makes no sense. I don’t recommend this version. 

Begging the devs to add a disable tutorial button, especially because I looked it up and it’s obviously a common problem, and it’s weird that they haven’t done it yet.

Also begging the devs to have some sort of basic instruction on how the campaign works or something. The first few games were okay to figure out on your own because they were more simple, but now it’s getting kind of ridiculous. I can’t be expected to patiently solve the mysteries of wtf is happening with these new rules while also fighting off monsters that get stronger with every island and if I die I have to restart from the first island. Or maybe I don’t. I honestly don’t know. The game is very confusing. 5/10",False,1722433069

"A spectacularly relaxing game, yet a little stressful at times (not in a bad way!).

Kingdom has been a series of games I've accompanied for years since the last decade, and I remember having loads of fun with New Lands on my mobile phone. Every minute was a minute of joy, a minute of relaxation, a minute of focus, a minute of a lot of things. 
New Lands left me with ideas as to how such a great game could possibly become better, and upon playing Two Crowns, it did not disappoint. As someone who came from watching Kingdom: Classic walkthroughs and playing New Lands, I was left amazed by all the new details, new features and new mechanics that were added. From being able to assign new jobs to your loyal subordinates and building new handy structures to being able to finally conquer the Greed once and for all.
Two Crowns is the better game for sure.

And that is not all - Two Crowns comes with content in the form of the ""Shogun"" DLC, which basically gives the game many new and unique visuals fitting the Japanese culture. The core mechanics remain mostly the same, though there are also new things (which replace those of the base game) that make the DLC feel more fresh instead of just being pure cosmetic content.
There is also ""Dead Lands"", which dives into a much darker and melancholic tone. It also has its many new visuals and a couple of new features, namely new unique monarchs and mounts. I personally prefer the base game and Shogun content more over Dead Lands, but it is still great and unique content nonetheless.

I have not touched the ""Norse Lands"" DLC yet, though it does look very interesting and the overall Nordic/viking setting is very appealing. Same goes for the recently released (or about to release) DLC that is based around Greece and Greek mythology, which seems to be just as fantastic as the previous content.

The gameplay loop is firmly consistent, and while it may seem to get repetitive quickly, it is not one of those games that take absolute ages to complete. You can finish it at your own pace, fast or slow, though the more time you spend building up your kingdom, the stronger the Greed also gets, so don't sit around for too long osay bye bye to your crown!

Overall, amazing game that deserves all the awards it received (if any).",True,1721164379

"This is one of my favorite games to get cozy and play and chill, or to really get into the gritty challenge islands when I want a challenge! 

It feels like there are 3 or 4 different versions of the games, like Norselands, Shogun, Dead Lands, and the Challenge Islands - each category and each challenge island with it's own unique twists. 

Several different mounts from several different playstyles, weaknesses, and abilities. 

Absolutely LOVE the depth in this game and years of regular play later, I'm still enjoying trying to meet challenges, and learn the mechanics of some sub-areas! 

The graphics are classic-pixel-art style, but super comfy and incredibly varied!

"The game looks and sounds lovely. I like the general gameplay loop as it is generally quite chilled out and relaxing with the odd taxing waves.

Got a lot of time in this game, but it still feels bad when things go wrong for seemingly no reason other than the game deciding to screw you over. Kicking you back to the start to rebuild makes it feel unbalanced and just incredibly tedious.

Add to that, they are just pumping out skins as paid for DLC, that don't really alter the gameplay all that much. It was novel at first and now it's just getting tedious.",False,1720368293

"Honestamente les diré varias cosas, se que es imposible que los desarrolladores lean esto, pero igual.

Kingdom two crowns es un juego relajante y magnifico para jugar solo o con tu pareja o mejor amigo, disfrutar de todas las expansiones de culturas, con jugabilidad diferente y una cada una.

abajo sugeriré varias cosas que podrían valer la pena de lo más a menos importante según mi opinión como usuario anónimo de steam.

1- Workshop: imagina este juego con mods de mundos nuevos, cambios de texturas y sonidos, siempre me imagine este juego pero al estilo warmahher 40k jaja, cambiando a los greed/codicia por Tyranids y a los arqueros por soldados, caballeros por Aster Startus.

2- Una nueva expansión de dlc sobre otra cultura, como podría ser la azteca, un lugar lleno de campos, ríos y bosques, donde los arqueros sean sujetos con lanzas, estén vestidos con la típica ropa que usaban ellos en esa época, con los tatuajes y cascos grandes, los caballeros siendo cambiados por soldados con un escudo y armas de obsidiana y sobre todo priorizar que al mejorar los materiales, se muestre como una evolución en esa época, cambiando aspectos de antes de desbloquear un material mejor, por otros.

3- Una expansión de Egipto, donde debemos hacer algo similar a la expansión de Grecia, alegrar a los dioses, para evitar penurias, solo que esta a diferencia de Grecia, que sufras las penurias y castigos de los dioses egipcios desde el minuto 0 y no solo en sus islas.

4- La posibilidad de reparar la parte trasera de la isla, ya que hay ruinas y zonas hechas pedazo, las cuales desaparecen una vez talas todos los arboles de la zona, bueno en vez de desaparecer, simplemente puedas gastar dinero para crearlas, que no tenga ninguna función, más que, que sea estético y demuestre que te gusta conseguir todo en cada isla, con un logro exclusivo al construir todo lo decorativo en cada expansión.

Solo soy un user random más de la comunidad, al cual le gustaría cosas como estas, esas son mis sugerencia, les agradecería que apoyen esta valoración de un juego magnifico, para ver si algún día los desarrolladores lo leen y aceptan algo de lo que he escrito acá.",True,1720213355

" A game that combines a relaxing atmosphere with charming visuals? look no further, Kingdom Two Crowns is a perfect choice for your Steam Deck. This game offers a chill experience, making it ideal for unwinding after a long day.

Kingdom Two Crowns captivates with its beautifully pixelated art style and soothing soundtrack, creating a serene and enchanting world. The game's visuals and music work together to create a calming ambiance that draws you in and keeps you hooked for more. 

The gameplay itself is simple yet engaging. As you gather resources and build up your kingdom, there's a satisfying sense of progression. The game's pace is steady and relaxed, allowing you to enjoy the process of expanding your territory and fortifying your defenses against the Greed. While the core loop is enjoyable, it can become repetitive over time. Navigating through your kingdom, especially as it grows larger, can feel like a chore at times.

"Deeply addicting mini-strategy game with minimal resource management aspects, just like the other Kingdom games. The main premise is to build your town, hire people, defend yourself at night, retaliate, repeat. Simple, sweet, and easily one of my favorite games to come back to every now and again. While the game itself is a bit repetitious, I find I get a lot of enjoyment from fine-tuning my strategies and finding the most efficient way to quickly build up a town. If you want more of a challenge, higher difficulties can absolutely get you that. 

Overall, I find Two Crowns and its somewhat old-school style incredibly charming and calming to play. The soundtrack is a delight and really adds to that relaxing atmosphere, especially considering how familiar the gameplay is to me now. There are various challenge modes with unique scenarios to take on, which I play often - they're great additions if you want a bit more variety. It seems like another DLC is in the works too, so clearly the game is still actively getting attention from the devs which is great!! This game also adds co-op, which has been fun the few times I've played with friends.

"Reviewing this game is very difficult, because there are many things i love but also a lot of annoying aspects. 

In favor of the game speaks that the pixelart is wonderful, the music is great, it is well suited for koop  and you can choose between different visual looks/cultures. 
While the gameplay is simple the game never seems superficial because there are many strange structures/hermits to find and the enemies can be quite challenging (depending on the game mode). 

The negative aspects are largely about the way islands are structured. You basically always build the same things in the same order and when you go to the next island you just do it again. While each island has unique places the overall layout is very repetitive. 

The game also has a problem with conveying information. While it is admirable to let players figure things out themselves, it sometimes just is not very clear. Many things can be understood if you just play long enough but given that the game-content is sometimes repetitive, i am not sure if players will stay that long. 

Overall i still recommend the game but only if it is on sale. 

I think it is great that the devs are still working on the franchise but in my opinion they should really focus on improving the core gameplay instead of adding different visual dlc. Right now every island has the same layout and consists of basically just one type of forest, one type of field and some small rivers and rocks to build stuff on. I honestly think if they just added a few more biomes and make it so that you build your base differently depending on what biomes your island has, the game would be improved a lot.

"Kingdom Two Crowns has successfully reinvented itself with a captivating new solo and co-op campaign mode. While preserving the core gameplay mechanics that have made the series a beloved franchise, this latest installment introduces a wealth of fresh content, including advanced technology, unique units, formidable enemies, exciting mounts, and hidden secrets.


For fans of the original Kingdom, the gameplay will feel instantly familiar. Players will still be tasked with managing their resources, building defenses, and exploring the surrounding lands. However, the new campaign offers a more structured and engaging experience, with a clear narrative and progression. This allows players to delve deeper into the world of Kingdom and discover its rich lore.



One of the most exciting aspects of the new campaign is the introduction of advanced technology. Players will have access to powerful weaponry and defenses, allowing them to build more formidable kingdoms than ever before. This is complemented by the addition of unique units, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. From powerful knights to agile archers, players will need to carefully consider their unit composition to ensure their kingdom's survival.

The Greed has also evolved, with new and more dangerous enemies appearing throughout the campaign. Players will need to be prepared to face off against fearsome creatures and cunning adversaries, requiring strategic thinking and quick reflexes.


The ability to ride mounts adds a new dimension to exploration in Kingdom Two Crowns. Players can traverse the landscape more quickly and efficiently, making it easier to gather resources and discover hidden secrets. Mounts also provide a tactical advantage in combat, allowing players to charge into battle and overwhelm their enemies.



As players explore the world of Kingdom, they will encounter hidden secrets and rewards. From ancient ruins to buried treasure, there's always something new to discover. These secrets can provide valuable resources, powerful artifacts, and even unlock additional content.


Kingdom Two Crowns is a testament to the series' enduring appeal. The new campaign mode offers a fresh and engaging experience, with a wealth of new content to explore. Whether you're a seasoned Kingdom player or new to the series, Kingdom Two Crowns is a must-play game that will keep you coming back for more.

"[h3] Disappointing Experience with Kingdom Two Crowns[/h3] 
As a fan of the original Kingdom games, I had high hopes for Kingdom Two Crowns. Unfortunately, this installment fails to live up to its predecessors in several critical ways.

[b]1. Lack of Innovation:[/b]
Kingdom Two Crowns feels more like an expansion than a true sequel. The core gameplay mechanics remain largely unchanged, offering little in the way of new challenges or experiences. The addition of cooperative play, while a welcome concept, is poorly executed and feels tacked on rather than thoughtfully integrated.

[b]2. Tedious and Repetitive Gameplay:[/b]
The game quickly becomes a repetitive grind. You spend much of your time doing the same tasks over and over again—collecting coins, upgrading structures, and recruiting followers. This monotony sets in early and doesn’t let up, leading to a stale and unengaging experience.

[b]3. Poor AI:[/b]
The AI behavior in Kingdom Two Crowns is disappointingly erratic. Your subjects often fail to follow orders efficiently, and their pathfinding abilities leave much to be desired. This leads to unnecessary setbacks and a general sense of helplessness as your kingdom crumbles due to AI incompetence.

[b]4. Lack of Depth and Strategy:[/b]
Despite its beautiful pixel art and atmospheric soundtrack, Kingdom Two Crowns lacks the depth and strategic complexity needed to keep players engaged long-term. The game’s simplistic mechanics become predictable, and the challenge diminishes as you uncover the optimal strategies early on.

[b]5 Bugs and Glitches:[/b]
Kingdom Two Crowns is plagued with numerous bugs and glitches. These range from minor graphical issues to game-breaking problems that can result in lost progress. It’s clear that the game needed more time in development to iron out these technical issues. Stop releasing DLCs, fix the Ai and fix the bugs. PS. infinite blood moons are not fun when you can't continue.

[b]6. Poor Value for Money:[/b]
Considering the lack of innovation and the abundance of issues, Kingdom Two Crowns does not justify its price tag. There are far more polished and engaging indie games available at a similar or lower cost, making this purchase feel like a poor investment.

In conclusion, Kingdom Two Crowns is a disappointing follow-up to the beloved Kingdom series. It suffers from a lack of innovation, repetitive gameplay, poor AI, lack of depth, numerous bugs, and questionable value for money. For those who enjoyed the previous games, this sequel may not meet your expectations. Save your time and money and look elsewhere for a more rewarding gaming experience.",False,1718662370
"Beautiful, simple, yet gives the right amount of challenge.",True,1718653869
"I played for the weekend and had a great time. It's a slower, vibey game with an engaging strategy side. It is obviously designed with simplicity in mind, for the most part only three buttons are required to play. It must be super accessible for differently abled gamers or for those who favor different input devices.

The game is gorgeous. The music is beautiful, even arrestingly so at certain moments. And the art style is pretty. Although, with the thin 2D band of active space sacrificing the upper and lower regions of the screen to inert scenary, it really had to be. Not a criticism, it really works. The animations are fun, the coin purse is especially fruity.

For some reason I expected the game to be short, so I was pleasantly surprised by how much there is to chew on. As a newbie to the series I enjoyed the pacing of the introduction, as mechanics were unlocked and introduced. But for some this might be on the slower side. It's a resource management game, primarily. Fun to play and iterate on, it’s challenging.

My main gripe: I get the feeling that this is a game with one strategic meta. One way of doing things right. That's fine of course, in the early game especially it is fun to uncover that and improve. But, being critical, I wish the late game had a bit more depth and strategic choice - even if this came at the cost of simplicity in design.

I got it free, but I'd happily have paid. This is a perfect game for a great weekend or week off work. And it won’t ruin your life.",True,1718619653
"Art + Music: 10/10
Beautiful. I may be biased since I'm a fan of pixel art, but they've really taken it to another level with the random fog, the background, and especially the water reflections. Music is also a great listen. I would've added all the songs to my playlist if it was released as an album (which explains why they're also selling the soundtrack separately.)

Overall Gameplay: 8/10
Strategy: 7/10
Only in terms of which tasks you're going to do first. It's more of a time management of: getting things built, having enough fighting units, and doing other tasks on time. 

Movement: 8/10
Can get repetitive going back and forth right and left. It's soothing in terms of ASMR and to relax as you listen to the music/ look at the art, but if you're in a hurry, it can get annoying. Sure, there are ways to speed up the movement/ teleport later, but until then, it can be slightly irritating.

Difficulty: 9/10
Challenging enough that it's wildly addictive. Would not recommend on a night before work. The (free!) DLCs are great for keeping off boredom for replays.

AI is also terrible in this game where they will be out building a wall in the middle of the night that you have queued 2 days prior to make all of your units be out of position.

"Neat and fun game in a very straight forward way. Maybe the simplest ""colony sim"" type game ever made. An easy (low resource intensive) go-to for when I don't have access to my main PC.

Pros:
-Impressive to see indie devs STILL adding content after 7~ years
-I'm not someone easily impressed by pixel graphics and I think this game is actually really nice and peaceful to look at (when you're not being beaten and robbed)
-DLCs have some variation from the base game beyond the reskinning, but the reskinnings are also very nice

Cons:
-Game does little in the way of explaining things and encourages you to make permanent decisions that the player might want to put off or avoid all together. Wiki helps but I wish I didn't need it.
-Hours played feels inflated because you spend a lot of time on each island waiting for villagers to reach destinations and generate coin. Could do with less idle time.

"Charming tower defense game with absolutely GORGEOUS pixel art! No numbers or clutter, just aesthetic, just game. Though I'm sure the style may get repetitive for some, my autism really enjoys the soothing simplicity, but with stacking difficulty each time!

The best part of this game is the variety of mounts and what they can do, and how that affects your strategies. The DLC adds tons of flavor, variety and aesthetic- I just wish there was more to do with excess coins, and that archers wouldn't leave their posts after a while once you station them. Lastly, I think adding more ""Kingdom"" elements, like lords/ladies/retainers, or more taverns and soup kitchens would bring it to life.

"Ladies and gentlemen, peasants and knights, gather round as I regale you with the tale of **Kingdom Two Crowns**, a game that proves managing a medieval kingdom is no joke – except when it totally is!

From the get-go, you're a monarch with a crown, a horse, and a dream. And that dream is to build a kingdom that's less ""Game of Thrones"" and more ""Game of Groans"" because of all the puns you'll encounter. The pixel art is so charming, it's like your screen got a visit from the Middle Ages, and they decided to stay for the graphics party.

The gameplay is a delightful mix of strategy and comedy. You'll recruit loyal subjects by tossing coins at them – because who needs charisma when you have cold, hard cash? You'll defend your realm from greedy creatures that are like the taxman, but with more drool and less paperwork.

And let's talk about the co-op mode. It's like going on a double date, but instead of awkward small talk, you're fighting off hordes of monsters and trying not to set your own kingdom on fire. It's the perfect bonding experience!

But the real kicker? The crown-stealing ghosts. Yes, you heard me. If you're not careful, some ghastly ghoul will snatch your crown faster than you can say ""regicide."" And there's nothing more humbling than chasing after your own crown in your royal pajamas.

In conclusion, Kingdom Two Crowns is a hilariously heartwarming adventure that will make you laugh, cry (from laughter), and maybe even learn a thing or two about feudal economics. So saddle up your steed, polish that crown, and get ready for a royally good time!",True,1717339038

The little people you recruit as your subjects quickly became my little children and I could not stop doting on the cute little buggers.

For a game this simple and that lacks almost any depth, it is unacceptable for it to be so incredibly buggy and poorly designed.

The game manages to be as relaxing and addictive as it manages to be frustrating and buggy.
I have encountered plenty of issues, bugs and game design that is frustrating. To name a few: trees not being removable, meaning you can't construct that critical wall there or continue clearing the land in a game that is time critical, work not being done despite there being enough idle workers, RNG determining weather you are going to have the game either completely snowball in your favor or death spiral uncontrollably at some point in the future, one entire run was lost because for some reason my almost entire army was on the empty, clear side of the map that could not spawn any enemies. you can not determine which side your troops deploy on through intended mechanics. You can only glitch the game into doing that by not building defenses on one side. Or what finally made up my mind: After many restarts to get a good island, after defeating an entire wave of greed spawned by exploring and being a few screens away, one just sprints at a supernatural speed (you usually can outrun them easily) and just bonks me and grabs my crown.
  This game has been out for a while and has many dlc (which are essentially just a reskin as far as I can see) yet many bugs are not fixed and many quality of life issues are not addressed, not even achievements or steam cloud work for example.",False,1717170859

[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*] Slow Pacing: Some players may find the game's pacing to be slow, particularly during the early stages. The gradual buildup can feel tedious at times, requiring patience as players gather resources and build their kingdom.
[*] Limited Replayability: While the game offers a rich initial experience, the lack of significant variations in gameplay and objectives may limit its replayability. Once players have completed the main campaign, there may be little incentive to start anew.
[*] Occasional AI Issues: The game's AI can sometimes behave unpredictably, causing minor frustrations during gameplay. For example, units may not always follow commands as expected, leading to moments of inefficiency or vulnerability.
[*] Minimal Tutorial: The game provides minimal guidance, which can be challenging for newcomers. While experienced players may appreciate the lack of hand-holding, those new to the series might struggle to grasp the mechanics and strategies without external help.
[/list]
Overall, Kingdom Two Crowns is a beautifully crafted game that offers a unique blend of strategy and exploration. Its stunning pixel art, engaging gameplay, and cooperative mode make it a standout title in the genre. Despite its slow pacing and occasional AI issues, it's a rewarding experience that is well worth the journey for those who enjoy building and defending their own kingdom.

"[h1]Kingdom Two Crowns is the most fun you can have while pretending to be a royal deer whisperer with a severe coin addiction.[/h1]
Imagine being a king or queen whose primary job is to throw money at problems and hope they go away. Now add a sidekick that’s a slightly confused horse. Welcome to the kingdom!

Your regal journey begins with you, a crown, and a horse that looks like it was drafted last minute from a petting zoo. You ride around, frantically throwing coins at peasants, trees, and pretty much anything that moves. Need a wall? Throw a coin. Want a soldier? Throw a coin. That mysterious statue? Better throw a coin just in case it’s important.

The game’s economic model is basically “If in doubt, toss money at it,” which, to be honest, is probably the most realistic depiction of royal life ever. Your main goal is to build up your kingdom and fend off the nightly onslaught of Greedlings – little monsters that seem to have graduated from the Academy of Persistent Annoyance with honors.

These Greedlings are relentless. They want your gold, your crown, and possibly your sanity. They come in waves, like door-to-door salespeople who won’t take “no” for an answer. You’ll spend your nights watching them tear down your carefully constructed defenses while you desperately try to recruit more peasants who apparently have the survival instincts of lemmings.

The best part? Your noble steed. This horse is the true hero of the story. It gallops bravely until it’s tired, which is approximately every five seconds, and then it pants like it’s just run a marathon. It’s the medieval equivalent of a car with a perpetually empty gas tank. You’ll find yourself talking to your screen: “Come on, just a little further!” as if it can hear you and cares.

Just when you think you’ve got the hang of it, the game introduces new biomes. Each one has its own unique challenges and ways to make your royal life even more complicated. Winter? Hope you enjoyed having money, because your farms just turned into ice rinks. The greed don’t hibernate, they just get more aggressive, like Black Friday shoppers after the last TV.

And then there’s the co-op mode. Now you can drag a friend into this regal chaos! Double the royalty, double the trouble. You’ll either become an unstoppable duo or end up bickering over whose fault it was that the Greedlings broke through the east wall.

Will you feel the satisfaction of expanding your kingdom and outsmarting the Greedlings? Occasionally. Will you wonder why you’re so bad at managing virtual peasants? Absolutely. Will you lose track of time and stay up way too late defending your pixelated crown? Without a doubt.

10/10 – Would recommend to anyone who enjoys medieval coin-flipping simulators with a side of existential dread.",True,1716825134

"my wife and I have been playing two crowns since it was released in dec 2018. we have over 1050 hrs on our playstation. we loved it even when it had tons of bugs in the beginning and playing around them was very interesting. sometimes i wish we could pick the version number to play on just to feel those early bugs again lol. since the pandemic, this game has become our daily relaxation time. we play dead lands -> standard - > shogun - > norselands and continue playing in that order on the hardest difficulty.. eighties was a bit disappointing for us but it was still a fun solo play, though we only played it once and never went back. now we find out call of olympus is coming and are super excited. onto another 1000 hrs.",True,1716742912

Coins are your health pool so don't lose them all (KILLED ME)
The boat leads you to another island and you can't get back until you build a new settlement + Ship (ALSO KILLED ME)

However, it's not all good. Gameplay does get a little stale after a while if you are playing alone. I recommend you get the game on a discount, which at the time of reviewing, it's 75% off so I'd give it a try!",True,1716429266
"The optimal version of the Kingdom series. Simple controls with no handholding, much of the enjoyment of this game is figuring out how to win by trial and error -  pitting troops you recruit and tech you upgrade against the Greed. Featuring fantastic bit-based graphics and a musical score I didn't immediately mute, my buddy and I really enjoyed our time with this game. Eighteen hours in we figured out how to win, and if we want to improve our stats or go for achievements there's still stuff to do.

So who should buy this game? If you played any other Kingdom version, this is the one you should play. If you like what you see and you're a gamer who enjoys experimenting and exploring, I'd say pick it up too. Completionists might like this, and folks who like challenges can look at some of the harder modes. It's not super deep, I'd say it's not super complex - but it doesn't need to be. It's a good game the way it is, and with reskins in the form of DLCs that tweak the experience it seems to still have life six years after release.",True,1716414602

"So deliciously good!

Such a simple control scheme, only 5 buttons in total needed to play, but there is so much depth and intricate gameplay that emerges out of it.

Game is best enjoyed in co-op, where the two of you, the king and queen decide how to build out and expand your kingdom while also protecting it from the threats at the Frontline, that attack your borders and try to steal from you. 

And the best part is: You truly play as monarchs here, you ride around your kingdom on horseback letting your army and workers do all the work for you, all while you sit regally on your steeds watching them. 

Excellent kingdom/nation building fantasy, done right",True,1715982212
"I really want to like this game but there are just so many infuriating things that happen, for example:
- Hunters aggroing enemies from the end portal over and over again panicking everyone and causing you to lose hunters.
- Extreme repetition.
- Nothing you can really do against flying enemies that go through half your base chasing after builders.
- Crown stealers being annoyances for really no fun reason at all.
- Winter is just a period of time where nothing can happen and introduces more busy work.

There are for sure more points but that makes a good list of what makes this all so annoying that I can't even finish this game.",False,1715968640

At no point is it ever adequately communicated what your objective is or what activating various buildings does, so you have no idea what you're investing your finite resources in until you've already played the game a bunch, AKA through trial and error. The game counterintuitively punishes you for trying to complete optional objectives like building lighthouses by making the game harder, and it's super easy to essentially get softlocked.

"Tough to rate. On one hand it's fun and simple, but on the other, it's the third game in the series and it's third pretty much rerelease of the same game, there's barely any more content improvement from Classic, which is free, and New Lands, so going from one game/dlc to another feels like playing ""new"" release of FIFA or Pokemon games every single year. 
Instead of releasing DLCs that are just reskins and add nothing or barely anything, in my opinion all that work should have gone to mechanics and content. Maybe then it would be more worth it's price. But as a standalone on some nice discount + if You've never played any Kingdom game before or You're looking for couch coop then it is still worth playing though, because it's just very fun for few hours :)

"
这游戏自己发展不过敌人，基本要赶时间炸洞才是要点，敌人后期无限上涨，自己的弓箭还被削了不能无限叠，王国扩张太快传送门要是位置不好走路都要半天，发展和建立王国更加像是摧毁贪婪的过程而不是结果，一直执着于发展王国高难度几百天根本不可能全炸完五岛。希望加一个无限地图，能自定义建筑平民；可以随地建建筑；增加建筑、风景和坐骑；贪婪强度有上限或者高难度的怪只集中于特定的刷怪地；增加城墙内快捷传送，可以游戏内玩上几百天的那种，想玩一个横版的带领自己的居民建设的大沙盒游戏。不过这已经是一个成型的好游戏了，有了自己的玩法，虽然一直一种玩法可能会腻，但是加太多新机制可能会水土不服，看制作组想把游戏系列未来塑造成什么样了。
In this game, you can't outpace the enemy's development; the key is to race against time to blow up the portals. The enemy's strength increases infinitely later on, and your own arrows have been nerfed so they can't stack indefinitely. If the kingdom expands too quickly and the portal is in a bad location, it can take forever to walk there. Developing and establishing the kingdom feels more like a process of destroying greed rather than a result, and it's simply not possible to blow up all five islands in a few hundred days on high difficulty. I hope to add an infinite map where you can customize buildings and civilians; build structures anywhere; add more buildings, scenery, and mounts; have an upper limit on the strength of greed or concentrate high-difficulty monsters in specific spawn areas; and include fast travel within the walls. I want to play a side-scrolling sandbox game where I can lead my own residents in building for hundreds of days in-game. However, this is already a well-formed good game with its own gameplay. Although sticking to one gameplay style might become tiresome, adding too many new mechanics might not fit well. It's up to the development team to decide how they want to shape the future of the game series.",True,1714534922
"I'm finding this game to be oddly addicting. I'm not super far in, but I enjoy the gameplay loop enough to want to leave a review.

At first I thought the slow pace of the game might be tedious after a while, but the opposite has proven true. I enjoy the methodical approach this game forces me to take but not being punished harshly for making mistakes. I personally love games where you're more of an armchair general than a soldier and this game lets me do just that.  Building up my little island forts is satisfying.",True,1714446567

If you are a new player that has never tried or seen any videos of it before, you should probably search some things up since the game doesn't really feed you all of the needed  information, but in my opinion, finding out what everything does yourself makes the game even more fun.

the controls are pretty simple though:

right/left arrows or a&d to move left and right;
shift is used to use a mount's special abilities (while standing still);
down arrow or s is for throwing/using coins;

I would totally recommend the game to everyone, but I believe the price is a little high, so you should probably wait for a sale.",True,1714248957

[h1] Kingdom Two Crowns - A Majestic Realm of Strategy and Adventure 🏰👑[/h1]

[h2]Overview:[/h2]
Kingdom Two Crowns, released on December 11, 2018, invites players to embark on a royal journey through a procedurally generated world filled with mystery, danger, and untold riches. Developed by Noio and Coatsink, this captivating strategy game challenges players to build, defend, and expand their kingdom while exploring the vast lands beyond. With its charming pixel art aesthetic, deep strategic gameplay, and immersive atmosphere, Kingdom Two Crowns offers an experience that is both rewarding and unforgettable.

[h2]Rule and Expand Your Kingdom: 🏰👑[/h2]

"This game is a lot of fun. its really simple but offers a lot. My main issue with this game is how slow and tedious it is by design. Part of moving the game forward is developing an economy so you can re invest it in your settlement and eventually progress the campaign forward. 

My issues is that its super fun and addicting to do that but its just so tedious. You have a mount that has limited stamina just because. Eventually your settlement becomes so large it can take a while to get from one place to another. It seems just silly and pointless for your movement speed to be so slow. 

In order to expand and grow your settlement you have to clear the islands you are on. Of course you have normal bottlenecks such as having enough builders or gold to accomplish the task or even if its the right time of day. At night the islands monster attack your settlement which makes it impossible for builders to clear land during the night time. So even though you have limited amount of time during the day to clear land it still its so slow. If your builders happen to be on the other side of your settlement because you cant control them and it takes them a while to get to the task you set, you are just out of luck. Even if you are lucky and your builders are where you need them to be you are still artificially slowed. As you clear land you have to wait for the background trees to disappear and catch up to where your builders cleared. It makes it incredibly frustrating and time consuming. 

Overall i like this game a lot. Its fun and addicting. Its simple but offers pretty deep game play. Its unfortunate that there are so many systems in place to intentionally slow you down.",False,1713752018

"It's a good game. 7/10
(-1 for bad Ai, units and greed alike)
(-1 for winter)
(-1 for save system)

Art is cute and fun, gameplay loop is great.
You do start to notice little negative things as you play more and your kingdom grows though.

The way the game assigns your units is strange, sometimes making them run all the way across the map instead of picking the closest for the job.

The units themselves are just quite dumb. The way they react to greed via distance leads to clunky and frustrating gameplay moments. You need to remember that people will die for their jobs. Combine that with odd unit assignment and you get casualties.

Units not returning to the walls before the greed arrive, even when not on a job, also is a problem in late game. Really just a poor design imo.

Winter is so... so boring. Legit makes me want to walk away from the game for a while until it's over.

The game's autosave feature is unpredictable and archaic. Don't make autosave overwrite someone's manual save file. It's not too much to ask for a separate place to save my progress safely.

How am I supposed to have maxed out walls on the first night, even with the 4 builders which I came to the island with?

So I either didn't get it after 15h or it's intended and since this game gives more of a cozy vibe I didn't it would disappoint in such a way which leaves zero to none reasoning or tactics.

"It used to be a flash game and it really shows, overall an extremely quick and basic game that's very pretty but with a lot of basic mechanics missing. Things I would consider pretty basic mechanics for any sort of building/colony management game (especially one with invasion mechanics) that this game lacks are being able to move/downgrade buildings (especially considering you can block off other  buildings on accident pretty easily as the whole game uses 4 buttons) being able to cancel buildings from being built, being able to choose the spots for buildings and not banking on luck for decent wall placement (I understand why farms need the river but why can I only build walls on random dirt mounds that often get in the way of the farms), not being punished for expanding your kingdom when that seems to be the biggest point of the game (you destroy camps and merchant camps by expanding which get destroyed or replaced with a worse version of each), and most importantly being able to actually control your people, change their jobs, have the armed ones actually be more strategic and not having the right side wall have 10 people standing around even though that sides portals are gone and there is basically no threat while the left side is destroyed, to name a couple of my issues with the game.

Basically you have 4 buttons:left, right, sprint, and throw money. Everything you want to do is done by throwing money at hopefully the right person or building and hoping you get the timing and building right as the characters move slow and 1 ill timed building too far from base can easily be a game over.

"Giving this a mixed review, with an overall recommend--but only islands 1-4

This is a game with great art, an addicting loop (run around, work on project, need something, run around, find another project etc etc) which can make hours disappear very fast. The music is another strong point. Overall, it creates a great atmosphere and it's a fun place to hang out.

The first few hours are just getting a handle on what can be built, how unlocks work, what exactly is going on, and how to progress. This is easily the strongest part of the entire game. I love games that start you out pretty lost, but give you just enough to get your footing. A+ here. 

You will lose a few times, but you'll realize that you did something stupid and you learn from it. Getting back on your feet is pretty quick, with some neat kingdom restoration along the way.

That's a wrap for islands 1-4. Imo, just consider the game complete at that point.

Island 5 is where things begin to get really weird. At this point, a loss means several minutes of bouncing between islands, gathering hermits and unlocking statues before you can get back to island 5. Further, island 5 has an *extremely* high variation between normal waves and retaliation waves, so it's very hard to gauge if you have the resources to go after a portal.

What does that mean for the overall flow? It means you have to have extremely large numbers of archers and upgraded towers + walls before going after the portals. What does that mean? It means waiting. Waiting waiting waiting for farmers to get enough gold, for villagers to spawn so you can buy them bows, etc.

Where this game fails, imo, is in knowing how to increase it's difficulty while also still giving the player enough information to make strategic decisions. The barebones UI makes for a good vibe, but you just can't tell what you can take on and what you can't, except through trial and error.",True,1712594645

"Very good, especially if on sale either way i recommend.",True,1712214194
"i give this game a 5/10
i had some fun with the game and there is some strategy and priorities you must do first like building up walls, recruiting peseants and giving them tools like hoes for farming, hammers for builders, bows for hunters or soldiers. to unlock certain buildings like a hoe tool builder you must upgrade your castle with gold, to get gold you must hire hunters to hunt animals which converts into gold or hire builders to pay them to chop down some wood which converts into gold. 

the enemies you encounter are called greed which are some sort of demons who attack you for your gold, gems and even your crown. the greed also mug your workers, the first hit takes away their tools, the second hit removes one gold from them which turns them into beggars begging for gold. 

to destroy the greed, you must explore the 5 islands and liberate them of the Greed. to get to these islands you must use gold to fix up an old sunken ship and it takes a lot of gold to fix, to get more gold you must quickly invest into your castle and hire more peasants, pay up for the hoe tool to convert peasants into farmers, invest more gold into building farms. it is expensive to do so, but the investment will pay off with an overabundance of gold to the point your gold will overflow your moneybag and start dropping so you need to give it to the banker to keep your gold. yes, can't keep all of the gold with you, there's a limit of how you can carry.

i did enjoy the game somewhat, but the problems with the game start to occur slowly over time when playing and expanding my kingdom.

the biggest problem i have with the game is that you can't defend yourself. a king would almost always carry a sword when traveling around his/her kingdom. OK fine, if i cant defend myself then can i have a detachment of bodyguard who can defend me? nope, you have to explore by yourself with a horse whose stamina is similar to an obese person.

another issue i have is collecting gold. from the beginning of the game, it is you, the king, who has to collect the gold in person, that's fine since you're starting rock bottom. as soon as you expand your kingdom and make more gold through investments of farms and recruiting more and more peasants to do farm work and the how long it is getting to travel from one side of the kingdom to the other becoming a full days of travel and the limited wallet space you have which prevents you from carrying more gold, or else having the risk of dropping them to the ocean which will be gone, why not hire tax collectors? will the developer for some odd reason said this in a discussion:

""I think it's important that the player purposefully drops coins for the Banker. I know he gives coins back frequently now, but I'd be scared of people wondering where their coins are disappearing.""

Im sorry but this doesn't make sense, im wasting my time collecting gold all the while i have to rapidly expand and upgrade the walls and towers before another greed attack occurs or else the walls would fall if the greed decide to do a major offensive which can topple my weak outdated walls and robs the people of their gold. also its very monotonous and sucks all the fun away when running around collecting gold to store in the castle. collecting gold from the farmers becomes a recurring problem to the point i had to stop playing the game out of boredom.

 i think this choice was intentional to lengthen and prolong the game. adding tax collectors will remove that repetitive chore away so i can put more time into doing other things.

another issue i had is controlling your forces, when a greed attack occurs, you have the left side defenses and the right side defenses since this is a 2D side scroll game. one of the defenses has more defenders than the other side, so it becomes unequal. if one side gets more attacks than the other side depending on the distance of the greed portal or lack thereof, the defense will just sit there while the other side gets clobbered and the people will get robbed and the walls will go crumbling down until the greed goes to the other side and destroys them too. 
Of course you'll say, ""why not just drag or order them to go to the other side?"", i wish i could do that, but you can't. The king you play as has no control over the kingdom, you're a slave to the incompetent system of the kingdom you've built. 

Kings in history always had a say on where to defend, how many soldiers is needed to do a proper defense if the threat is great or decrease defenses if the threat is lacking, in this game the defenders decide where they want to go. It's like if the Wehrmacht in WW2 said ""Screw the USSR, its too dangerous and cold there, we want to defend Paris because its nice there"". another problem since this is military related, you cannot convert hunters with bows into soldiers with bows even though i have a massive workforce of hunters who can become into soldiers. Bow soldiers do occur, but instructions on how they become one is not explained. I have an excess amount of peasants who don't work who can become city guards, that option of conscripting them into the military is non-existent. you can have 4 captains who can lead assaults to attack the greed spawn portals but you cannot field an army of defenders to repel massive spawn invasions.

One big issue with the game is that the ingame instructions on how things work is very very lacking and vague. it does give you some simple instructions like how to hire workers, build walls, cut down trees and upgrading walls and towers. What doesnt explain is how does it hire military archers, how do the defenders know where to go when under attack or if they respond to an offensive that's whooping the A.S.S.E.S of the defenders on the opposite side of the Kingdom. 

The game would be a 8/10, but the gameplay issues i experienced really ruined my experience with the game, If steam added a 3rd option for rating, my score would be a Meh or mixed score. if the developer really plans on making a sequel, the dev should really add in gameplay improvements that can really give you more control over your kingdom on how things should be done.

as of now, i don't think i can finish this game since i don't want to be frustrated or bored. welp, time to go back to warhammer 3",False,1712213266

This game feels REALLY BAD to mess up in. Like if you sail to an island by accident and did not take all your troops. There is no way to cancel this. This game punishes you a lot for simple mistakes and then when you lose, you lose HARD. I lost a 223 day run because RNG knocked my crown the wrong way and once that happens, its GG. 

This game does not really TELL you anything on how to play it, or what the upgrades do. You just have to wiki it or assume, which the assuming part is very hard. I wish they told me a bit more about what the statues do or each hermit upgrade. 

Finally, the lack of a main menu is a really weird. You boot right into the game. If you saved in an unfavorable spot, you are screwed and again, see the mistakes tab above.

I really wanted to like this game, but it became really repetitive and really punishing. It is very akin to how I felt with Thronefall. It starts off really fun, but after a while, it is a wash. 

Also The three like versions of the game are presented odd. Like you have no idea that you can change the skin of the game until you are too far into your run to have to start over with a Japan reskin. I could not bring myself to justify playing the game a second time around as well if I had finished. Very much a one and done game.

"A masterpiece of game design. It excels on so many levels. The gameplay is great: it's crazy how much depth is hidden in a game that can be controlled with only 3 keys. I absolutely love how Kingdom doesn't explain you anything, and the player needs to figure out how things work by experimenting and observing. This is a fantastic experience in itself, and the stupidest thing one can do is to read or watch a tutorial before playing. Deciphering all these little visual and sonic clues is priceless. Visual design is brilliant. Sound design is great. Music is so fitting that after many hours of playing I still enjoy it.

I wish I could erase my memory and experience the magic of the first play-through again. But repeated runs are fun too thanks to the coop feature and a number of challenge modes. Don't be a greedling, buy this game!",True,1711965545

"I liked the art for the game and had a good time playing with my friend until the game completely soft locked due to a bug, and our run of 4 hours was destroyed because the developers not placing any safeguards in their code for people getting stuck on the first island without a way to destroy the portal.

although I think the game would be good on sale for a lot of people (I bought it for $5), it seems like the developers care more about pushing DLC rather than making sure the game works and feels intuitive. after losing the run I had to research for 3 hours why the game was even softlocked just because the game itself tells you SO LITTLE about the goals/mechanics of Kingdom, and although I sometimes like that for the fun of exploration, it feels completely out of place at moments when me and my friend can't even figure out how to use a boat for an entire 2 hours because the game doesn't tell you both players need to be in the same exact place.

"I think its ok game for 5€, if you know what you are buying, and for spending 10-100 hours in.
I've only completed the main champaign so far.

[h2] Game to be played with 5 keys only [/h2]
I think it's cool how you can make a strategy game that uses only max 5 keys, but as a monarch all you can do is to move, explore, hire people and tell builders to build something. Monarch cannot participate in fights by themselves, which I thought would have been cool, but their mounts still may be used for combat.

[h2] Lack of in-game guidance [/h2]
The game may be hard to understand without online manuals, because there isn't much description in anything in game. Only a ghost in beginning that helps you to setup your base.

[h2] Easy to play, but with a cost [/h2]
Because most of the things in game can be done with just using 3 keys, the game is easy to play, but it comes with the cost of controllability. Most of things you do as monarch cannot be undone, which can be very annoying, because accidentally marking wrong tree to be chopped can make bad things happen. Also builders are so annoyingly stupid, they have no idea when it's time to return to the base and will eventually lose their expensive hammers to greed, and there's nothing you as a monarch can do about it.

[h2] Other junk to complain about [/h2]
The online multiplayer mode worked quite well with 2 players, but I don't understand why I don't have option to quit the game? The option to quit the game is just grayed out and if I as a non-host want to close the game, I'd have to do it using task manager. All achievements don't work well in multiplayer game.

The graphics seem minimalist and should run smooth on most devices, but if it doesn't there is not many options to optimize the game to your preferences, for example I think the reflection feature is just waste of my computer resources, I'd like to get rid of it, but there is no builtin way to do it.

Generally I don't recommend unless you know what you are buying.

"I don't know what it is about this game that captivates me so much to the point where I didn't sleep for 24 hours one time just because I was so focused on playing this game and another time when I completely forgot to eat for the day. Kingdom: Two Crowns is an Amazing 2D Relaxing  Minimalistic Micro Managing game and the best one out of the Franchise Hands down.

The Game itself is incredibly simple, you take care of a 2D kingdom by managing the money essentially and doing as much as you can before nightfall. There are only a few units you can get and a few buildings as well but the simplicity of the game is what makes it so good. There is no overly complicated mechanic that you need to worry about or any deep thinking. However, if you do get careless which can happen very easily since the game tends to be hard in certain points, you can lose in the blink of an eye. That might sound like the stress can be overwhelming but in reality, this is one of the most relaxing games I've played. It can get hectic if something goes wrong but the game always makes you feel in a state of Zen while playing (the Soundtrack aids to this as well) and it always has you saying ""just one more day"" constantly to the point that you don't ever quit to stop playing.

There are 4 campaigns if you get the DLC. They are all the same conceptually since the gameplay loop doesn't change but each campaign gives you new things to play with which can make the experience feel fresh and new at least for the first few hours of play. I say that because sadly the game can get repetitive for some after long sessions. I sure felt it many times while playing when I was just waiting around doing the same thing to get to a certain point so I could progress. But again, there's just something about the game that just makes it not feel so terrible or annoying. It might have to do with the fact that the in-game days do not last long and since you can only do so much, you keep going without realizing.

It's a great game! A very Relaxing, Atmospheric, and fun Game. Good Game to turn your brain off after a long day and feel cozy while playing it. Buy it! Full price or on sale, it goes for pretty cheap. and it's 100% worth it.",True,1710948464

While running away from the greeds when you get a bit too adventurous is stressful, the game overall is quite relaxing, and if someone needs a quick bathroom break that doesn't stop the game.

[th]PROS:
+ Being able to play this along with a friend speeds up progression and is a hell of a lot more fun.

+ It's a massive step forward in what they've added to this game previous to the two other titles (I won't spoil what they've thrown in but it's makes everything so much more fun)

+ It's still got it's simplicity with the controls.

+ NPC's are so much more intelligent, this was one of the major downfalls in the previous titles.

+ Losing your crown doesn't mean a complete game over, you're forced to go back to the previous island which is a huge positive for this game.[/th]

[tr]
[th]CONS:
- It's still repetitive, not major enough to be disliked but it's still there, play it in small bursts to keep things fresh.

- Jumping on the boat and the next island is in the winter season, it's a probably because you can't bring spear men with you, making it near impossible to survive a winter season.

- You have to pay to remount a mount you've already unlocked, why?[/th]
[/tr]
[/table]

[table]
[tr]
[th]VERDICT:
This is where the game peaks, right here, in their 3rd instalment, I don't think they can exceed here and it's the perfect place to probably end the franchise, maybe with a few DLC's to add a little more content but please, PLEASE. Don't release another game with the same content, many of us have fell into that trap with the previous Kingdom games.

If you're new to Kingdom, just buy this title instead of the others, they're exactly the same, just with added extra content on each game so there's no need to buy the previous games.

Total Score = 78/100.[/th]

[th]GAMEPLAY:
It is the third entry in the Kingdom series. Players control a mounted monarch as they attempt to defend their kingdom from a race of monsters called the Greed. The monarch can recruit villagers to perform certain jobs while building defences such as towers and walls to fend off waves of Greed attacking the kingdom at night. Kingdom Two Crowns features single-player and cooperative multiplayer modes, with cooperative play enabling two monarchs to join via a split screen.

"Kingdom Two Crowns : By Triple F

""Kingdom: Two Crowns"", the 2018 sequel to the award-winning Kingdom: New Lands, builds upon its predecessor's foundation, offering a captivating blend of minimalist strategy and tense resource management. While staying true to its core gameplay loop, Two Crowns introduces innovative features like cooperative play, new environments, and a wealth of challenges, making it a worthy successor and an engaging experience for newcomers and veterans alike.

The game's visual style remains a strong point. The pixel art, while simple, is vibrant and full of character. The day-night cycle is beautifully rendered, with the warm hues of sunset contrasting starkly with the cool blues of nightfall. The animations, though minimalist, are fluid and convey a sense of purpose in the movements of your subjects and the encroaching Greed. The minimalist approach extends to the user interface, with intuitive icons and subtle sound cues effectively communicating information to the player.

At its core, ""Kingdom Two Crowns"" is a game about balancing resource management and defense. You, the mounted monarch, ride your steed across the side-scrolling landscape, spending your crown to invest in structures and recruit workers. Farmers cultivate land, builders construct walls and outposts, archers defend against the nightly invasions of the Greed, greedy creatures that swarm to steal your crown and plunge your kingdom into darkness.

The core gameplay loop is addictive. Each day brings new opportunities to expand your kingdom, gather resources, and fortify your defenses. The tension builds as dusk approaches, culminating in the frantic scramble to gather enough coins and ensure your walls are sufficiently manned before the Greed arrive. The satisfaction of successfully repelling an attack and witnessing your kingdom flourish is immensely rewarding.

The most significant addition to Two Crowns is the introduction of cooperative play. Two players can now share the burden of ruling a kingdom, each controlling a separate monarch and contributing to the overall development and defense. This cooperative mode adds a new layer of strategy and communication, as players need to coordinate their efforts to build a thriving kingdom and overcome the challenges together.

The game also expands the world with new environments, each with unique challenges and aesthetics. From the lush greenery of the Shogun Lands to the snowy peaks of the Norse Lands, each environment offers fresh gameplay experiences and requires players to adapt their strategies. Additionally, technological advancements, mounts with special abilities, and hidden secrets add depth and replay-ability to the experience.

While the minimalist approach is praised for its elegance, it can also lead to some limitations. The lack of detailed information or tutorial elements can leave new players feeling overwhelmed at first. Additionally, the single-player experience, while enjoyable, pales in comparison to the frenetic energy and shared triumphs of cooperative play.

Furthermore, the game's difficulty curve can be unforgiving at times. Resource management is crucial, and a single mistake can have cascading consequences, potentially leading to the downfall of your kingdom. While this can be viewed as a positive aspect for players seeking a challenge, it might be frustrating for those who prefer a more forgiving experience.

Despite its minor limitations, ""Kingdom: Two Crowns"" remains an exceptional strategy game. The combination of beautiful visuals, addictive gameplay, innovative cooperative play, and diverse environments creates a truly captivating experience. Whether you're a seasoned strategist or a newcomer to the genre, Two Crowns offers a rewarding challenge and a unique journey of building and defending your kingdom. With its minimalist charm and engaging gameplay loop, Kingdom: Two Crowns is a crown jewel in the realm of indie strategy games.",True,1709431983

"I don't think Kingdom Two Crowns is a game for me. The game is a chill but not 2D settlement builder tower defense game. The concept does sound interesting but the game is from my perspective designed to be intentionally slow and a little too minimalist. During my playtime I did not find any means of learning how certain things function such as the bell that empties your village into the boat or how you cant direct your soldiers to kill the last portal. I'd recommend checking out the game on a stream or via a demo ( if one exists) before getting the game.

Pros:
-Nice consistent art style
-Interesting concept

Cons:
-Incredibly slow gameplay
-No in game tutorials or even a guidebook to allow you to learn more about things outside of experimentation. Its cool to have a minimal design but I found it too minimal in explaining how parts of the game work.
-Achievements don't seem to work reliably. I did multiple things and the achievements didn't unlock for them.

"Oh God. I don't want to negatively review this game, because I actually really love it, but I just can't recommend a game with so many bugs. Well shit, here we go.

First, game mechanics don't work quite alot of the time, though which ones don't and which ones do sort of seems to be dependent upon the play through. For example, in my last play through, I could not send knights on one specific side of the map. On this play through, I can't have my units stand guard against the greed (the greed you can think of as zombies if you'd like, even though they're not).

Second, on one play through, though it only happened in that one said playthrough, my builders were glitched, moving left and right rapidly in one spot, so that the stuff that needed building did not get built, so this one specific bug in particular was a run-ender.

Third, and SPOILER ALERT: In another play though a while back, I could not complete the game at the end of the game because the units would not move inside the cliff, so this was a game ender at the end of the game, though I did not negatively review the game despite this because I really like the game, hence the reason why I chose to play the game today. 

But yes, despite my love for this game, I will not recommend it if it's filled with so many bugs. Quite frankly, the developer needs to hire some play testers in order to hammer out all these bugs. 

Having said that, if by any chance any of the above is due to a lack of my understanding, then this is because certain things weren't explained in game. It is a simple game, after all, you could play the game with only the arrow keys. And there is a tutorial. So, unless the game explains to me otherwise, I am presuming that all of the above are bugs that need fixing.",False,1706544329

The game is all about show, don't tell - meaning, you have to figure out most things yourself as you play. But of course, they let you know of the basic controls, so you don't need to worry about that.
It's story driven, 2D open-world game. You have total of 5 islands to explore and conquer as a king or a queen. 
There's also a wide selection of characters to play with different outfits and genders. 
You can also select the level of difficulty to play in, so that you don't struggle on your first play-through.

Some tasks could be grouped to make them less tedious, so that you can toggle, at the main building of your base, to spend x amount of coin to upgrade x amount of structures at a time or train x amount of archers, builders etc. at a time and even stack to a waiting line, so if you set that you want 8 archers in total and 4 people pick up bows, another 4 bows would be crafted automatically. Could also use a fire alarm system to notify you if any walls are preached on either side of your Kingdom. So an alarm torch wielder would be another workforce you can assign. Way too often I have no idea that one side of my Kingdom has been SEVERELY breached before I even realise it and then its a bit too late to help out. Thats about it, if the listed above were a thing, this game would be way closer to perfection, but that doesn't mean I won't recommend it, I had a lot of fun and pretty much binged it.",True,1705964328

"TL;DR: The game's nice, but it suffers a lot from a weird difficulty handling: you just restart the game every couple of days until you get a good RNG for the first island and then snowball the entire game in a repetitive cycle. Good if you get it as cheap as possible.

I'm always amazed at how this game can simultaneously be a brilliant & innovative masterpiece and also a shitty, underwhelming experience.

While the aesthetics and ambience are top notch, the gameplay suffers from an attempt at keeping it minimalistic while also being overly convoluted at times. Back when the first game came out it was understandable that you had little control over anything because there was little to do at all; but now we've got a proper full game with tons of mechanics, content, DLCs... 

But the game is still as obtuse and unresponsive as it was at first. I get the appeal of 'guiding' your villagers to work and having to think in advance the process of orders you need to chain, but when your Kingdom is half the size of an island it starts being so bothersome to do anything you spend the majority of your time going from one side to the other without much else going on (even with the portals). It's especially aggravating when you factor in other weird decisions like putting a Griffin mount in the game that can't be used for flying or making the AI so dumb they get themselves in trouble whether they have orders to follow or not.

None of that matters against the worst aspect of this game, which is the difficulty: an absolute joke that depends partially on the level you chose and mostly (MOSTLY) on the RNG.

You can play in Easy and have a lot more trouble than in Hard if you're unlucky enough at the start. Sometimes you'll get an early chest nearby and boost you considerably and sometimes you'll find yourself encroached between two enemy portals without that much space to navigate through. I've lost count of the amount of times I've had to restart a game before the first week had ended because it was clear it would take much more effort than what it's worth because there are only two ways in which you play this game:

· You have an especially awful case of bad luck and lose in the first two weeks.

· You have either average or good luck. It doesn't matter which since it will only determine how long it takes for you to reach the spot of no return where you snowball through the entire island.

Once you learn how the game works, you just need to rush to get farms early and then expand until you can send expeditions against portals; you can easily cheese the portals if you've got enough money by standing behind them and leave a ton of coins on the ground while your troops shoot down the portal; if you leave the coins close enough the Greed won't target your troops and instead go for the coins, so you can just wait there until it's done.

You can do this on any difficulty, the only thing that matters is the initial layout of the island and a couple of hours in you can already guess from an initial scouting of the area around your kingdom whether that particular game will be worth it or not. Later on it's even worth it to simply die because that will reset the wave counter to Day I while keeping your kingdom intact, which basically means nothing. And even then, after that it's the same exact thing for each island when they are all pretty much the same. I won't even talk about the challenge islands either, the differences aren't pronounced enough to matter.

It's not even a bad game, just one that's all over the place. Get it with a big discount.",False,1705759814

And also having your only source of income on an island you just reached be deer, which your worthless archers *will not* hunt down and kill and even when they get lucky and *do* kill one, they don't bother picking up the coins so you die on the first blood moon because you have no income yet.

"This is a very fun kingdom management game presented as a 2D side-scroller, with a very minimalist interface.  While I was able to get started off and play a game through mostly intuition, I eventually had to look up how certain things worked in the Kingdom wiki.  

Kingdom management games are not usually presented as a side scroller and I enjoyed that uniqueness, but some islands get very wide resulting in a lot of running back and forth that can eventually get tedious.  There are portals you can use to create two-way bridges to alleviate this.  

One gripe I have is that there is no map view so you will have to commit to memory the layout of your island or spend a lot of time running back and forth.",True,1705358065

"Fun little game, but I'd recommend looking for it on sale. It's a simple gameplay loop where RNG can be pretty painful. The game is definitely more fun with friends, and if I wasn't doing go-op I think I'd probably enjoy this game a lot less.

For the good parts though: 
- The music really good, when it plays. It goes through long gaps of silence with sudden music out of nowhere. But when it plays? Great stuff.
- The death sometimes feels not earned, but.. if you do well on an island and make good use of the castle keeper holding money, you can prep for death. When we first started we had no idea how this worked, but after learning we had a good store once we died. We'd rez, instantly fill our bags, build up the town a bit to build up troops, then hit the island that gave us trouble again with full money and full troops. This made things easier.
- Portals make life so much easier sometimes, it's a great mechanic when you've been ripped off and sold a horse with no stamina.
- Once we figured them out, the archer hermit for the upgrades and the statues were really helpful.
- I like the mounts, I just wish we could get double for some of them. I also wish they'd get balanced a bit more. A war horse that is used to carrying a full on armored knight should not be slower when carrying our characters. I sort of feel like a trained war horse should have some of the best stamina..

The iffy:
- The RNG can be brutal. We landed on an island and couldn't expand or get a farm because of the portal placement. We destroyed the portal eventually with help from troops on other islands and ... IMMEDIATELY after were other portals! Like, we couldn't cut down trees.
- RNG relation to Greed: We had a time where over 8 of the spawner guys came out for revenge after destroying the first portal. They absolutely wiped us.. we had this happen several times. We got lucky once when it was only like 2-3 of them. This should have some sort of logic. Though it would also be one of the times when portals/mounts/second player comes in clutch: Revenge only happens from one side, and it's random. Really helps to have someone on the other side who can buy explosive barrels, but this just really shows that RNG is brutal here. RNG also plays a part in placement of things. We had to cut some farms in half because the builders wouldn't cut down more trees until a wall was there, but the wall was right next to a farm spawn.. right after the farm spawn? Another wall. We'd have huge areas with no turrets to build up and another area with no wall for many screens.  This sucked because we'd basically lose all the troops on that side if one wall went down since they can't outrun Greed.
- Gameplay loop: It's a fun game, it really is. The loop though can get a bit tiring after being burned constantly by RNG. If it wasn't for the fact that we can prep for the next generation, this game would definitely not be a recommendation.

All in all: It is fun. Definitely better in small doses. 100x better with friends. Read up on some of the mechanics, don't waste gems, and just enjoy a mildly panicy and cozy little game. Almost a farming sim in some cases.",True,1705252083

"I love this game, primarily because of the atmosphere. Pixel graphics, calm music, pleasant colors - I love all this charm. The gameplay is clear and simple, all you need is to be and run here and there, build various things, support your people (who are very cute and sometimes act funny). Destroying portals is fun. It is also possible to change the riding animal (and even the weapon).
Now about the cons (there are very few of them). People act a little strange sometimes. For example, if a large area is cleared of trees, the archers can go too far and when it gets dark, they simply do not have time to run behind the wall. Also, loggers, after the work done, go to the wall, as if they went for a short walk, taking their time (of course, there is no hurry, because as soon as it gets dark, they will start ""running"").

"I really like the game. It looks nice and its basic style is so calming. the gameplay is really unique and simple. just use your arrow keys. nice Idea. So I recommend it. Cant stop playing actually.

BUT it has issues that hurt especially if you play it single player:

1. its slow and bogs down over time. No not like just by design, but the more area you cover, the slower the gameplay becomes. the developers give you portals, but those are never at the center of the map, so if you ever do something in the middle you then have to watch your avatar ride in one direction for a while and often you have to make several trips. for minutes over minutes. I bet the entire play time of the game is 50% running without experiencing any content. wich is sad. especially when you have almost completed a map, built your fortress to the biggest expanse and are trying to destroy the last enemy portal. that took me almost an HOUR of just recruiting two knights and archers, watching them aproach the gate, watching them gather troops, then waiting for the next day cycle because its too dangerous to start mid-day, then aproaching the enemy portal, watching the two cohorts shooting some arrows, getting killed and then you have to repeat the entire process again. literally 10-15 minutes for every cycle depending on if you have gathered enough archers quickly enough. and in that time you press like 10 buttons and thats it. the rest is just watching pixels move. the game is pretty. but not THAT pretty.

so long story short: the game really needs some form of speed up for the late game: 
a portal in the middle of the map and some way of making soldiers faster. 
my idea: a wagon taxi building operated by workers. it is as fast as a riding horse and it can hold like 5 troops or so. and then you can upgrade that wagon to be faster or sth. Its not game-breaking. just a little speed up to help get through the late game a little faster. then it wont take an hour, but maybe only 30 minutes. still long enough to ""get the vibe"" if you know what I mean.

2. Glitches. Especially in the late game of a map I have encountered more and more weird glitches where things I want to use, like the Diamond hoarder, or the portals just seize their coin operation function. Or a tree has blocked a building and when I removed it it took the game 2 minutes to realise I can now build there. or one time my workers just refused to accept I ordered a new wall to be built. Wich is really annoying considering that game cannot be so complication that this isnt fixable. And looking at this games release date I am really suprised this was never fixed.

I have low hopes this will every be fixed because of this games age. But maybe some of the devs hear me and think about it for their next game design.",True,1704559977

The game is very addictive. Be careful. I warned ya,True,1704057089
"This game is addictive. I got really into it for two weeks. I don't think I really enjoyed much of it, and I often felt like I was wasting my time. I think I just liked the artstyle. But no game has infinite replayability despite how much ""procedural generation"" devs try to shoehorn in. Eventually I ran out of new content to see and was finally free from the curse.

My problem is that it's very repetitive. It's tower defense with much less complexity. I think sidescroller just isn't right for this type of game. An interesting experiment to remove a dimension, but top down is much better. Tower defense is already a simplified version of RTS and this simplifies it further. Since you only move left and right, the gameplay is literally one-dimensional.

A run progresses like this: You send some guys to the left and right to gather materials. You build some farms and towers to the left and right of your base. You walk out to the left side and collect everything you find. You beat the enemy outposts. Placement of things is randomized, but enemy placement is fixed because it has to be and you'll find all the things out need at some point. There is no searching and playing with the hand you are dealt based on your skill at exploration, one dimensional movement means you are just given what you need in a random order. You return to your base and build more different types of farms and towers to the left and the right. You walk out to the right side and collect everything you find and beat the enemy outposts. Repeat this until you have enough guys to go to the end of the map and beat the boss and clear the run. Once you have figured out the formula and done this a single time there is never a reason to think about it in any other way. You can use different characters and progress through a couple different maps, but it boils down to the same thing.

I don't consider it a waste of money, and my description might sound fun to some people. But there are better games to play for $20. Pick up something with an overwhelmingly positive. Tooth and tail is more of an RTS but it scratches the same itch in my brain ten times better. But nothing in this genre has really beat Warcraft 3 mods for me. That said I did get almost 40 hours out of it so IDK. I might have fallen asleep with the main menu open though.

this game is nice,True,1703680684
"+ Good pixel art
+ Good soundtrack
+ Changes to this iteration makes the game fun to play.

If you are looking to play Kingdom, this is the iteration you want to play. The game doesn't push you to progress and you rather dictate your progression yourself most of the times. After you get the stone upgrade you are able to survive for quite a long time. You can either destroy the evil on the islands immidiately or proceed to another island or go back. This choice is wonderful as it adds to the flexibility.

Griffin mount is must thanks to its stamina and ability to eat anywhere on the map making the erands and going around less pain to do.

"I am 32 years old.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

It insists on showing you how to upgrade your farm over and over and over again.  Same thing for upgrading towers.  Beyond that nuisance, getting to the 3rd island (on default difficulty) is a pain.  By the time you're prepared to go there, you're so far into the game that the nightly attacks are way overpowered compared to your camp.  The power creep of the enemies is not at all balanced; it gets bad rather quickly, all things considered.  The one time I did get my 3rd island camp in a good place, when I went back to my first island camp, it was overwhelmed so badly the first night back that it was destroyed and so was my ruler (lost his crown).  As for finding tips and tricks from the community posts in various places... let's just say mileage varies.

"Honestly I just can't recommend after getting screwed multiple times.
It's an absolutely gorgeous game in both soundtrack and art design, though the pixel art does make it difficult to make out what some things are. Even so, it's just fantastic to look at in general. The changing of the seasons, the reflection of the water, the backdrops, the skybox, it's all amazing.
Without looking up a guide, I was unwittingly turning structures into other structures that I didn't want and had no way of reversing these decisions. That's one of the major downsides; there's no undoing a decision. If you accidentally turned your forward operating archery tower into a bakery at the game's suggestion, there's no way to fix that.
The lack of ability to directly command troops is crippling in situations like Blood Moons where the enemy will only come from one direction, but you don't have enough troops on one side to fend them off.
As I mentioned in a community post, the game is fully willing to let you kill yourself without realizing it; I'd used a Warhorse to blow up a cave and the horse was so slow and had so little stamina that it was impossible to escape the blast in time. Because why would you want to use the mount best suited for empowering troops when you're fighting a horde of enemies, dummy?
After the warhorse death, I started with the next ruler and went through the half-hour minimum rigmarole of going from island to island: Re-enabling my boosts, reacquiring mounts and hermits, and restoring broken island walls and civilians. Then I went to Island #5 and got a blood moon on the very first night, with about 7 giant enemy-spawning tank enemies that plowed through my settlement. 
I had 2 Knights and a squire, all outfitted with full archery squads with blessed arrows, and they couldn't kill a single tank enemy as they kept swapping which one was in front to take the blows. To my knowledge, I had done absolutely everything right by fully equipping my troops and building defenses, only for the game to decide to just kill me on the first night, well beyond when I could have possibly made defenses strong enough to take on the horde it threw at me.
So while I liked the game for a while, I just can't bring myself to start over *again* knowing that I'm wasting my time and will just be killed immediately when I try to advance. I can take the hint.",False,1701452438

"Very unique gameplay with an impressive amount of variety and replayability. Two Crowns has a few campaign options and that is where the replay happens. For example the Shogun campaign is just like vanilla but it is reskinned like imperial japan with some buildings changing into a unique ability or structure. It is addictive and I've returned to this game many times over the years. I haven't found another game like this.

Noteworthy cons:
- Deer often flee TOWARDS you instead of away, which makes herding them towards archers frustrating because it is heavily implied as a stream of income. Seems like artificial difficulty.
-  Some common-sense survival techniques are not done which can be un-immersive or frustrating at worst (archers stay in completely useless towers which wastes a unit)

"[h1]Kingdom Two Crowns[/h1]
[h3]And to a certain degree: The whole series[/h3]

A game about figuring out if you just can't progress or if it is a bug you encountered.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Kingdom Two Crowns is a game that has the interesting idea of a mix of a city builder in a sidescroll style mixed with an adventure. If this sounds strange: It is and I probably didn't manage to describe the game at all with these words and this marks the greatest strength of the series. The game feels fresh, interesting, new. I played a few games by now and have yet to find a game like this (but probably won't since they are not quite my cup of tea).

Basically you run around on your horse and use coins to tell your people to chop some tress, build some weapons, walls or towers and... I mean, that's basically it. There is not much more to the gameplay loop. And if this sounds like the worst part: Sadly it isn't yet. I have to add that this loop feels good! Constantly expanding, figuring out what to do next, what to build first, can you send out more workers or will they die because the monsters come at night, can I skip another wall or will this lead to my workers dieing to the monsters because they ran too far. It's a good concept and I've had my fun with it, even though it got repetetive pretty darn fast.

The biggest problem of the game sadly comes with it's biggest strength: You can't control your workers intelligently, especially in Coop they sometimes run from one end of your 2-sided base to the other, back and forth and back and forth, which feels pretty bad and often enough ends up deadly. Even worse though is the one thing that I couldn't get out of my head: [u]What the heck am I even doing?[/u] The game doesn't explain anything to you except for the easiest button prompts. You will encounter buildings with strange emeralds that you don't receive, you can't upgrade your walls or towers because... you need an axe in a tree? Also something about a horn? Wait a second, now I have an emerald and I can carry another person with me... doing absolutely nothing? Oh, cool, a boa........ And I left my island. What could have been a cool game about figuring out what to do becomes a frustrating task of doing an island and then leaving it half baked feeling like you are on a fetch quest just constantly repeating island after island after island after island until you have enough ""Meta Game Currency"" to finish the game? I never got there, but that had other reasons too, more on that later.

[b]Balancing:[/b]
Another big problem lies in the balancing, especially in the four seasons. While you have three seasons (something the game never tells you) where everything is fine, you kill some animals, develope agriculture, sunbath (okay I made that one up), you will then pretty much without a warning enter the fourth season: Winter. And the game comes to an abrupt halt. Nothing works anymore, you run out of money in mere hours without any income and if you have had the bad luck of just recently switching to a new island you can basically just leave your PC running and go play some soccer outside because there is literally [u]nothing[/u] you can do to prevent from being slowly overrun by monsters. While winter isn't a guaranteed death, it can be if you made a choice that you didn't knew you were doing.

Now the problem is: Except for winter the game is a walk in the park featuring no challenge after you have figured out the games core loop, which takes less then an hour to understand. So no, this is not a gritty survival-sidescroller. It's just badly explained and even worse balanced. This is not a ""soulslike-city-builder"".

[b]Music, graphic and technical stuff:[/b]
While the music is good, if repetetive, and the graphics are fine, if you don't mind the 2D-style, the technical aspects... it's a desaster. Even years after it's release the game bugged out on me several times with gamebreaking bugs. Sometimes a tree just wouldn't get felled so you couldn't advance into one of the two sides. Sometimes you have had to take a dozend tries to connect to your Coop-Partner. And then, one faithful time, my workers just wouldn't continue building my boat, so I was effectively [u]deadlocked[/u]. I would have had to wait for SEASONS until the enemies finally managed to overrun my city so I could die and get sent to an earlier island. And this bug, five years after the games initial release, is an [u]absolute No-Go[/u].

The craziest thing about the graphic though is this: You always have these gorgeous backgrounds of massive mountains with viking faces or giants being slain by a spear higher than the sky and I couldnt stop myself from thinking: [i]Why can't I play THIS game instead[/i]?

[b]Summary:[/b]
While the game features an interesting concept that I loved to explore, featuring good graphics and music, the core gameplayloop was not only repetetive and unbalanced, it was plain broken. If not for that, you could get a few fun hours out of this game. But as it stands right now, 5 years after its release, I still can't recommend the game and would rather get a refund.",False,1699196151
"The game only gives you the barest of directions. The rest is for you to figure out. I like the sense of discovery you get when you come across something new and go ""Oh, interesting, how does that work?""

It's more of a meditative tower defense than anything you have control over. The only controls in the game are move left/right, sprint, and throw money at things. You just gotta figure out what the right things to throw money at are.",True,1699177697

"Pros: 
[list]
[*]Serene music & environment
[*]vibrant and immersive aspects: An adjacent river that adds a third dimension to the environment and spearmen will occasionally catch fish from the river, creating interaction between the foreground and mid ground. This is one of the best and most immersive parts of the entire game.
[*]Useful items and unlockables hidden across forests, encouraging exploration
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
[*]Lack of unit commands prevents manually moving units behind cover or removing them from archery posts, this is frustrating due to unit AI issues
[*]Unit AI Issues: unit AI response is prone to getting units attacked, builders will build outside of barricades during enemy invasions and on-foot units behind nearly breached barricades will retreat too late; units also don't collect player's coins when their coin bag overflows
[*Units are too slow: if they are behind a barricade and it gets breached, enemies will instantly attack them before they can flee
[*]Many unconveyed game mechanics: basic game mechanics are explained but most aren't e.g. clearing forests allows for more hunting, it's not clear if building multiple wheat farms affects coin yield, special buyable objects don't explain there uses, seasonal events, etc.

"It took me 7 hours to come to terms with the fact I strongly dislike this game. A chilled-out medieval management indie game with pixel graphics should be right up my street, but it seems everything about Kingdom Two Crowns serves to frustrate the player.

[h3] The positives. [/h3]

The game's pixel graphics look gorgeous. The rain effects, the background art and the water effects are all sublime. The music also hits exactly the right tone, relaxing and atmospheric.

[h3] The negatives. [/h3]

The game is on a 2D plain, where the only controls are left and right. The player takes control of a monarch who hires peasants and [i] requests [/i] (I use the word request specifically) construction using coins. It's those same peasants who do everything, including collecting more coins to hire more peasants. The peasants can be assigned to become hunters, farmers, knights, builders, etc. The issue is that everything is autonomous and nothing can be queued. Need more archers? Hard luck, you've now got 10 builders! 
      Peasants also move very slowly, and being autonomous will run from one end of other map to another and back again because there is no priority queuing. Want a builder to construct a wall then a tower next to each other? No gonna happen. He's just decided to do another job on the other end of the map...

Issues with navigation also extends to the player. The player navigates the 2D plain on a mount which is able to gallop using the only other dedicated button. Unfortunately game goes out of it's way to make the mounts obnoxiously slow and for gallop to last a frustratingly short amount of time. This make navigating the map an absolute chore which is a problem because moving is one of the only two actions available to the player.

These are the frustrations that you're going to be encountering the most, but they are by no means the only frustrations. The reason I mention these specific ones is that they make the gameplay annoying to it's core. 
      There could be a beautiful, relaxing game here; if the player moved a little faster. or there was less need to constantly move back and forth from one end of the map to the other. But unfortunately the main emotion I felt playing this game was exasperation.",False,1698516608

"I played the first Kingdom a time ago, and had obtained each new version when it came out, Two Crowns being the newest. If you had never played Kingdom, it's a very simplified city builder/tower defense where with a simple set of controls build a settlement to make money, recruit subjects to build and defend it from waves of monsters at night. Though yes, simplified, where the way you issue commands is pretty much paying people gold to ""Build X"" ""Make X tool"" or ""equip X Tool"" the testament of this game is how complicated it gets, even if the controls are pretty much ""Move, run, drop money to pay for X"" As you advance the game, you explore new locations and unlock better tech and upgrades to bring the fight to the monsters that attack you at night, allowing you to full retake and conquer the land from them.

With a Japanese/Norse theme to go with the main game, which switch up how some build works and units operate, this has been one of me go to games to fall back on and play a few hours if I don't know what else to play.",True,1698475225
"Ironically- the most enjoyable way to play this game is solo, this is because the difficulty doesn't ramp up (or at least in my experience, didn't noticeably ramp up at all) properly for co-op, making it way too easy if you're playing with others. 
I'm not even particularly good at the first game, and this thing is a complete breeze if you're playing it for what its made for (co-op), too much of a breeze honestly.

I understand that difficulty does not a good game make and I'm not for rage games whatsoever, but a lot of the experience is the struggle with the kingdom series, and just barely overcoming it, which is an awesome feeling. 

I was expecting a co-op version of this game to require a lot of focus and good communication/coordination to keep things smooth and plenty of close calls, but... even by the last and 'hardest island,' I barely needed to talk to the person I was playing with at all for much of anything to the point that it would often be totally silent for half of the experience- because nothing of actual concern was ever happening. Its almost so safe at certain points that this could be considered a lo-fi chill game and I was feeling sleepy, never on edge.

If you're playing it alone, its closer to the experience of regular kingdom games. Even then its still easier because of the new content this particular game in the series offers (namely the hermit that can attract the homeless so you don't even have to venture out, and the stag mount that lets you completely glide through the forest with insane speed). 
But regardless, if it wasn't priding itself so much in being a co-op game, I would give it a good rating. But, nah, I cant. It just wasn't what I was looking for.",False,1698474937

"While I can certainly see how people get into this game (and I gave it more than a fair-shake at 14 hrs), it's just too infuriating to recommend.  The decision-making is very light, the actions are repetitive, and the pace is tedious.  You will ride your mount back and forth, across your kingdom, so many times.  So many times.  And you will periodically be forced to let the fucking thing graze.  

There's an appeal (for some) to games that let you learn while playing.  A multilayered onion for you to peel, revealing secrets and clever bits that feel all the more gratifying because you ""discovered"" them!  But there's also potential frustration - and Kingdom Two Crowns celebrates frustration like you wouldn't believe.  Sure, I learned the value of archers and builders and money and walls and towers and farmers all on my own.  And I eventually figured out the boat.  But I had no idea how to close the portals.  Because you can't without squires/ knights.  But you won't get those until you unlock stone.  Which might not be on your island.  Oh, and do you even know the point of the game?  The victory condition?  Am I supposed to get on the boat?  Should I abandon my island?  What am I trying to achieve here?  Have fun figuring it all out - or just reading an incomplete wiki or poorly written steam guide.  Not worth it.

It would help if sending the army would be highlighted somehow so i don't do it accidentally.

"Beautiful and atmospheric game with pleasant music. Well helps to relax and at the same time perform not annoying management to protect and strengthen your kingdom. Everything looks quite simple, but at the same time mesmerising and fascinating in the gameplay. 
At the beginning of the game you have nothing. I can say that you are a naked king. But a little time will pass, and you will have subjects, who will become useful assistants and your companions. You will have archers, knights, woodcutters, bakers, farmers and your other subjects of various professions. 
The really nice thing is that you can leave tasks to your subjects and not have to watch them complete them. Don't worry, they will complete everything and return to base. In the meantime, you can walk around, discover and explore the area.
At first it was very disconcerting to see the lack of interface in the game, but then you get used to it and it doesn't seem strange anymore.

Good game - if you have time give it a chance!
See my profile for more details about my reviews.

Additional notes: this is probably the best of the series in terms of content (the previous game is now a level in this one, and you have a campaign to do, which saves all your levels etc...). Amazing little game of atmosphere, creepiness and building your base, without any explanation. Great lore and visuals, stressful mood, fabulous gameplay with one button... You might then wonder ""why a B and not a rank A?"". The thing is, I already played the previous 2, so as a gamer like me there is less surprise and discovery here. Plus, I think the game is starting to get very repetitive and grindy, so a B is still a good praise in my opinion - if you never played Kingdom, this might definitely be a A for you. Especially if you play in coop - I did not have the opportunity so it might be quite an interesting experience! Kingdom is a classic you OUGHT to try.",True,1696925625

This of course takes even more time. All that being said runs end abruptly after many hours of this tedious grindwork.

"Summary of the game:
The Kingdom Two Crowns (with its latest/current updates) brings various gameplay mechanic-related fixes and improvements, it's almost like it's the v2.0 update of its predecessors (Kingdom: New Lands, Kingdom: Classic). This makes you question the pricing of the game since this one is labeled as a separate game. Even though this game is much complete version, I still can see aspects and sides of the game that still seem unfinished or unpolished.

Cons:
- Main Issue: The devs don't want you to progress continuously without losing at least at the beginning of the playthrough. If you progress the game quite well or too long (i.e. 120 days), after a 3-4 land journey you might not even survive the first day in the new land because of high difficulty and not being well-prepared for an attack wave, then the game hits you with ""Defeat is the experience of loss and the empowerment of beginning anew."" quote, as if there was any chance to survive. Almost like the devs wanted their game to be roguelike, but they've failed at implementing it. 
- gameplay/UX/UI: no instructions, no warnings, sometimes you enter ""somewhere"" and it doesn't tell you that you can't finish that sequence if you don't have damn 5 coins. What do you do?
- gameplay/UX/UI: Can't restart or play a new game, you just have to continue it,

Pros:
- Nice to see couch co-op/online multiplayer versions,
- More complete version in all aspects: gameplay, art style.

Aside from all the unpleasant sides of the game, it is still a fun experience and a time waster if you have plenty of it or you have someone to play with.

[update]
Avoid playing the game on ""Cursed"" difficulty. While it is indeed challenging, if you're skilled at the game, this mode becomes more of a grind than a true test of strategy. Instead of relying on thoughtful tactics, you'll find yourself stuck in repetitive grinding.

[update]
Do not buy this game. Not worth the money nor the your time.",False,1696732417

"This is the best of the Kingdom games and I heavily recommend it, which are all worth playing as they each play a bit different, this version contains 3 or 4 (one is dlc) new versions of the game to try out with different abilities and new skins for most sprites, Kingdom Two Crowns has a handful of hermit craftsmen which enable impressive upgrades and has wild new mounts such as a massive stag that enamours fellow deer and a powerful shining griffin and a mysterious black armoured unicorn all of which are quite fast, the beautiful artwork which is standard for this franchise is present as usual but this time many additional background layers are added for a mesmerising illusion of depth combined with constantly evolving atmospheric phenomenon. In all this a nice game to look at.
This is the most forgiving version of Kingdom as each day you can count on the merchant bringing you money if you don't break his house and you can envelop campsites without destroying them so long as they have a tree on each side netting additional vassals with ease (b)and(/b) in two player mode the game persists so long as one player retains their crown.

"Kingdom games described as a micro-strategy games, and I concur the term fits them. However it is a recipe for frustration for players, because of how little you can steer the ingame systems and mechanics. I wonder how it could be if they discarded the '' you shall not micro-manage nonsense '', would it be shorter and a nicer experience? What I know is this was a bit of a grinding, biting the lips kind of game for me. Got to write about my gripes with it.

This game is not cozy and definitely not chill.

The first few levels are a fun game about exploring an island, building it up, and defending it from raids during the spring, summer, and fall.  You'll be ready to set out for the third island around autumn.  But what you don't realize is that winter is brutal, and so is the third island.  Resources go from abundant to scarce while enemies go from raiding parties to two screaming hordes assaulting you from both sides every night.  Gameplay shifts in a single map from being about exploring and balancing resources to disaster triage as your starving populace spends all day desperately trying not to fall behind in rebuilding the defenses that the hordes destroyed the previous night.  Nighttime events are apocalyptic.  The minimalist interface doesn't allow for things like directing troops or canceling commands, meaning that a single misclick or even just bad RNG can spell disaster.

On the other hand, this game is ridiculously bad at telling you what is going on and the unbelievable amount of trial and error did cost me 5 game hours for sure.

"While I can see why people enjoy it, this title is not for me.
Game feels very slow and while I don't mind more relaxing titles, here it's taken way beyond my liking. Besides, while gameplay speed increases slowly then finally you're going to get fucked within seconds when, while destroying previous waves of enemies easily, suddenly Greed appears and destroys your whole village. This forces you to either:
 [list]
 [*] Play super carefully, building every possible wall/tower spot only to get fucked anyway after a tedious few hours because ""hey you've been alive for too long, its time for you to die so now the waves have 5 Greeds, enjoy!
 [*] Play quickly but then the game goes ""oh no hihihi you're GREEDY deal with those 3 Greeds you're totally unprepared to deal with since you tried to be quick hihihi""
[/list]
Beyond progression, there's few mechanics that (from my pov) are there simply to annoy the Player: I'm talking about your previous settlements slowly getting destroyed while you're not there so after each death you need to spend some time repairing them as well as the way your movement works.

Let's focus on that second topic:

So the game is a side-scroller where you can move left or right. Your character's movement speed is tediously slow but you can gallop, which increases your speed slightly but tires your horse out. Your horse is tired? Wait for him to rest. If you don't want him to get tired that quickly, you can find area where the grass grows, stop, and wait for him to eat grass. Waiting, waiting, waiting, move tiny bit because he gets tired soon and then wait a little bit more. Basically 75% of the game you're just running from one building to another.
On later stages of the game, when you destroy some enemy portals you can build your own, which you can link. This helps a little, but still isn't enough to fully remove tediousness from the basic premise of gameplay - run from place to place.
Who would have thought this could be a good idea? Designer(s) of this game. Is this a good idea? Hell no. What results from this system is dominating majority of gameplay time being spend on waiting or running.

So, summing up:
Pros:
[list]
 [*] Magnificent pixel art
 [*] Chill and relaxing gameplay that doesn't require your full attention
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
 [*] Gameplay gets very repetitive quickly and each island feels just like the previous one, only difference being prefetermined placement of spots where you build stuff
 [*] Very slow progression, for me personally it feels way too slow
 [*] Not a lot of actual gameplay choices - you can't decide what type of building and where you put it. You have a spot - you can build what the devs wanted you to build there, or ignore it. That's it
 [*] Personally I'd much prefer more mechanic focus on building up the island over slightly developing multiple of them one by one
 [*] Actuall gameplay area taking just ~15% of center of your screen wears off within first hour and become an annoyance
 [*] Too much focus on soulless running and waiting for your horse to regain stamina / eat grass so you can run again

Micro strategy is a good term for it, as there isn't a much decision making and interactivity, but it creates a relaxing loop of building up your kingdom for nightly defense and exploring islands. The visuals and music are outstanding. 

The game has a fatal flaw for me though. 

The fun in this game for me is expanding my kingdom across multiple islands, creating multiple safe and money making ""cities"" before heading to the next. The winter season slows your growth rate to such an extreme extent without adding additional threats that I decided to just leave it running for about an hour while I watched videos and wrote this review. 
It would be fun if it was an extremely tense season where all other seasons are to be used to build yourself up to even survive for a short period of time, but its a boring slog of even less activity in this already limited game that I would rather afk until the fun seasons begin again than progress at a snails pace.",False,1693582631

Gave it another go, Got to 3rd island after ""full"" clearing the other 2. I was having a good go of it and was near one of the walls during a big wave, 2 big dudes, 4 or 5 flying guys and the regular Greed. It turns out one of the big guys was carrying a greed and sent it over the wall, it one shot me even though my purse was full of coins, my crown ended up outside the wall or something and the Greed got it. They ended up getting away and all I could think was, ""Wow, I wish my guys would go after the crown"". The game is fun but as someone who feels like they need to full clear the island or at least as much as you're allowed to dying is just such a big hassle, I love the gameplay and stuff but it just feels really dumb when you die to something stupid with no chance of getting your crown back and having to redo everything.",False,1693559763

"Two Crowns takes everything that New Lands did and builds upon it further. For starters as the name might imply you can now have [b]two[/b] monarchs for the price of one ruling your lands. This game has local and online co-op.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027963011

This game is everything the previous games were and so much more. More buildings, more units, more mounts, more enemies, more things to spend money on, more more more. There are also 4 campaigns including Norse Lands and Dead Lands (Bloodstained crossover) where the monarchs don't take things laying down and take a more aggressive approach to cleaning out the corruption of their lands. That's right, some of the monarchs are no longer helpless anymore.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027894284

The game also now introduces the concept of heirs and roguelite progression. When you die the next heir in line will pick up more or less where you left off, your castle, your armies, your unlocks. When portals are closed they stay closed for the next heir. And shrines now stay unlocked for the remainder of the run instead of having to be reactivated every several days. No more starting over from scratch. In essence parts of the game got a whole lot easier because you get to lockdown certain elements of progression in place.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027894368

Of course for those missing the true roguelike challenge of the oldskool Kingdom there's challenge mode. One life, no heirs, all progress is reset upon death, and enemies attack you from both sides like they used to. It's the ride or die experience of Kingdoms Classic with a new coat of paint.

Also you dont need much strategy. Just build a big settlement with enough coins and enough archers and soldiers and thats all. It only takes a lot of time to do this. Then you go to the next island and repeat this.

"Addictive, I even set aside getting my morning coffee some times. Took me about [b]25[/b] hours to beat the game once, but I am the type that absolutely has to build all walls and towers to max level across all the islands. There are far more efficient ways to play and I have heard folks speed running a play-through in [b]4 to 5 hours[/b]. The fact that the shogun and dead lands DLC are [b]free[/b] is a good plus. They allow you to play the same game, but because all the sprites are different it feels a little less repetitive. You absolutely do not need to buy the Norse lands DLC but frankly it is worth it to support the game, and gives you yet a fourth skin for your kingdom.

The game-play loop is very simple, you need to gather coins through taxing your people, you need that coin to coerce new people to join your kingdom, you need that coin to build bigger and better walls and towers, buy equipment for your folks. There is a little catch, your greed gets punished by... well the greed. They want your wealth and you better be ready to either pay them off, or fight them (that is where the walls and towers come in). The more you destroy the greed, the longer you survive, the stronger the greed becomes. If you can no longer fight them off, or pay them, they will take your crown, and, as the game puts it: [i]'No crown, no monarch.'[/i] Death is not the end however. Whichever way you like to role-play it, you re-spawn as a new monarch, with a new crown. Maybe you where a son or daughter of the previous monarch? Maybe the previous monarch is merely a footnote in history and it is a 1000 years later? Either way the previous monarch's work is decimated, but not entirely gone. You can build on the legacy of the previous, repair his walls and try anew. The Greed will need some time to wake up and realize you are back and you play as if you are back in day 1, keeping many people, though losing most equipment, walls broken down, but these are cheaper to rebuild then to start from scratch. 
Eventually you need to become strong enough to take the fight to the kingdom of the greed (every island has a lair). Destroy that lair, and seal the greed on that island for good. Repeat that 5 times and you win the game. 

Maybe 20 euro is a bit steep depending on your purse, but even at full price I am still going to give it a solid recommendation. If you aren't sure if you like this type of game and style of art, wait for a sale, I doubt you will regret it.

"Absolutely superb game 10/10 hands down.
A prime example of  what happens when a dev goes full focus on the core of the game and gets it as good as possible.

From the visuals to the sound effect and the music choices (absolutely dig the sound track it works exceedingly well). 

Hats of to the dev's just on gameplay, visuals and sound/music it ties together perfectly.
From a game design point of view excellent example of how to do it right.

Best way to sum it up is a side scrolling wave survival where you build up a kingdom.
Move from level to level unlocking new upgrades to the point you beat the final ""dungeon"".

If its your thing you will very quickly lose hours running up and down your kingdom.

Only negative if you can call it that is it is probably at some point a bit dull to replay. Though a minor negative.
Challenges are quite challenging and keep it fresh.

"The game is very addictive for the first 6 hours or so, but it gets dull afterwards. The game is good...generally, as I really wanted to gives this game a thumb down for various reasons yet I had also arguably had a great time playing this game to be honest.

I fully understand that the game goes for the minimalist design in terms of UI and gameplay, which makes it a highly accessible game for casual or non-strategic-hardcore players. However, because of the lack of any basic information (due to the game's intentional minimalist design) for any purchases and upgrades in the game, it makes me feel that I was playing the game half-blindfolded. I did not know, for most of the time, how well to be exact when I upgrade this or that: how much range it increases if I upgraded the archer tower? How many hit points were there if I upgrade the wall? What does this or that hermit do? Where can I obtain the material I do not have? Most of these information are the basic information for a strategy game, but this game literally has none of those. I understand the appeal of it, but I genuinely thinks that if the game provides these information, even as a choice, the game would have had much more fun for me. 

Due to the game's minimalist design, even when I finished the game, I still did not know what some of the upgrade does and why some things go that way instead of the opposite. The game doesn't tell you anything. Were it not for the guide I looked up, I would probably have stuck longer. I really hate the kind of games that requires the player to look for guides just to play the game NORMALLY, and this game can almost be categorized as that kind of games; I said ""almost"" because the game encourages you to go trial and error in order to find out how things work, and it almost punish you nothing when you fail to understand anything. Dying or losing multiple times doesn't change much other than the duration required to finish the game. And this is how the game works. If this gameplay mechanic doesn't incentivize you to explore, it will certainly frustrate and irritate you, which is the situation for me in latter progression.

All in all, Kingdom Two Crowns is a decent game for casual players or those who touch on strategic games for the first time, but if you have even a remote understanding of how strategic game works, this game can be frustrating and irritating in its lack of direction and information. The first few hours of experience is absolutely mesmerizing; the music, the pixel art style, the beautiful scenery...they all follow you as you stroll along your kingdom, making you wish that you could one day live in places like this. A perfect game for a leisure afternoon in the weekend.",True,1691553083

"Kingdom Two Crowns (KTC) isn't a game, but it attempts to disguise itself as one. It's one of those idle clicker activities that braindead people sit around on their phones/ipads tapping their screens for hours to collect resources to build more things that generate resources so that they can generate more resources to build more buildings that generate resources. The big difference between KTC and those other idlers is that in KTC you're idling in real time while waiting to gather resources, running around to gather those resources, and running around to spend those resources... enjoy.

Here's how KTC works. There are 5 islands. You start on island 1 and your goal is to build up and eliminate the Greed from each island. You start with a small base somewhere towards the center of each island. You build up the island by spending gold coins to hire people, provide them a tool for their job (builders/lumberjacks, archers, pikemen, etc...). Your workers are all fully automated. The only thing you control is your character on a horse and the only things you do are move left/right, sprint/animal special ability, and spending/dropping coins. You then spend coins on preset spots of the island to do various things such as: upgrading parts of your base, trees (to chop down), dirt piles (expands your base), stones (makes a guard tower), etc. You generate gold through the various things your people do. Chopped trees generate coins, archers hunt animals which drop coins, you can pay a gold coin to a merchant who wanders off for the day and comes back the next with 10 coins, etc. There's a ship on each island which allows you (and a few of your workers) to sail to the next island or a previous island.

Each night, the Greed will attack. Your archers (and pikemen once unlocked) will line up behind your outermost wall on each side and defend it. The difficulty slightly increases after each night (more enemies, masks which make them take more hits, etc). If you ever have no gold coins and get hit by an enemy, it knocks off your crown. If an enemy grabs your crown and runs off with it, you lose, causing you to restart on island one with all your prior progress but causing the nightly attack difficulty to reset and 100 days of decay to each of your islands. This essentially just means all your prior building spots are still there, but you have to spend coins on them to repair them so they function again. You can't ever really lose in this as far as I know. It just makes you waste time getting back to where you were.

So lets get to the main problems. What you're doing on island 1 is 95% of what you will be doing throughout this and by part way through island 2 you've seen 80% of the content in this. Let me explain what you'll be doing. You're going to run left, collecting coins from your workers and spending them on things until you reach the far left side of your base and maybe slightly beyond to spend on trees/stones/dirt. Then you're going to run right, collecting coins along the way and spending on things until you reach the far right wall of your base and maybe slightly beyond..... Now are you ready for this? You're going to then run to the left again, collecting coins and spending on things along the way until you reach your far left wall. Now I'm going to tell you something that is really going to blow your mind. You then run right again and do the same exact thing. Repeat this for 20+ hours. What a blast!!

Why does this all take so long? Firstly, your coin bag can only hold around 40 coins. Once you hit 40 coins, they start spilling out of your bag, oftentimes dropping off into the water and now gone forever. Beyond that, if you collect gems (for unlocking certain upgrades), these go into your bag as well, decreasing how many coins you can hold by 3-5 for each gem. This wastes a ton of time simply because you can't hold all the coins you're receiving. Secondly, your horse has stamina and it runs out quickly. Once you've run out of stamina, you have to spend 15-30 seconds waiting for it to replenish. Thirdly, as your base gets larger, the time it takes to cross it increases significantly. It takes maybe 10 seconds initially, but then goes up to 20, then 40, until it's taking you 2+ minutes every single time you're running across it. Let me be really clear here, you will constantly be running across your base to collect coins. If you want to not hate yourself, you will want to get the Phoenix steed that is on the first island as soon as possible since it has one of the highest stamina and movement speeds in this. Unfortunately, you don't get gems to unlock it until you're at island 2, so you'd have to sail back to island 1.

Even worse is that Kingdom Two Crowns purposely wastes your time from the outset and you have no way of knowing that. You see, you can't actually eliminate the Greed from any of the islands at the start. Your technology is limited until you gather the special resource from island 2, and then it's limited until you get the special resource from island 4. It's only after getting 2nd special resource that you gain the ability to eliminate the Greed from any island. Until then, all you can do is destroy their portals, which allows you to expand your base out further (which is mostly pointless). Each time you destroy a portal, the Greed immediately counter attack instead of waiting for night time. 

What you also don't know is that each time you destroy a portal, it increases the strength of all future portal counterattacks. So every portal you destroy on the early islands simply makes it harder for you on the later islands. This means that rather then building up each island, what you should be doing is setting off for island 2 as quickly as possible, grabbing that resource, then setting off for islands 3 & 4 as quickly as possible to gather that 2nd resource. Doing anything else prior to this is a complete and utter waste of time.

Let's make something else clear here as well. You will reach a point where you will have your crown knocked off and lose, going all the way back to island one. You can then expect to spend around 20 minutes repairing each island before you get back to your furthest island. Why will you lose? Not through any fault of your own, I assure you. You see, when you go to a new island, you won't have the coins to build up your outer walls strong enough, hire enough people, have strong enough towers, and get enough archers/pikemen to defend yourself. You will be overwhelmed. Even worse is that if you're destroying all the portals on each island (which you will since you don't know not to do that), by the time you hit island 4, the counterattacks will be so tremendous that there is absolutely no way to defend yourself from what is coming. These counterattacks include a bunch of flying creatures which take mulitple hits and which pick up your people and fly off with them along with around 10 giant husk creatures which take a bajillion arrows to kill and which knock out your walls in a matter of a few seconds.

Kingdom Two Crowns is utter garbage. It attempts to trick you into thinking you're playing a game, that there's something more to it than what is initially presented. As you go through it, you'll realize there isn't anything else. There's no plot, no story, no characters, no dialogue, and nothing of substance. If you have anything resembling a functional braincell in your head, don't play this. I assure you that all that awaits is pain, suffering, and wishing for the sweet relief of death.",False,1690484926

The pixel art is very good, and the artist is obviously talented, but you will waste a massive amount of your time in this game simply moving your character left or right, collecting coins and upgrading your buildings at a glacial rate.

From a tower defense perspective, which is essentially what this game is, the game play is extremely poor. It may take you upwards of 3-4 minutes just to traverse from one side of your base to the other, at which point invading enemies have not only broken through your defenses, but have formed an unstoppable wave because you were busy defending the opposite side of your base. That's simply a flawed premise for a tower defense game.

"A long time ago, the greed (monsters) in Kingdom were like little green creepers which made strange squelchy noises, walls were wood, ballistas were great, your goal was to survive for as long as possible, and peasants had to be hired every single day manually. The great thing with growing up with the Kingdom series is that now you have purple greed, metal walls, fire towers, bombs and bakeries. If any of that makes you curious, you should try out Kingdom Two Crowns :)

The game is supremely replayable, if you play it on cursed, you can definitely get a kick by the fourth island. If you want to have really heart pumping fun, move there in Autumn! While I'm secretly annoyed each time I lose my crown to the crown stealer, I'm always quite happy to see that my hard work storing money with the banker pays off for the next try. 

At its core, Kingdom Two Crowns is about earning money, planning the layout of your kingdom and spending money - the Wiki is very through if you have any questions, otherwise, it's fun also to learn and explore things on your own. For example, you know that you're hooked when you use a watch/timer to track the progress of your 4 minute long days. 

I love this game, the art is beautiful, the mechanics are cute and quite versatile, there are no undo buttons except force quitting to return to the morning bell. The peasants give you too much money (and then they're broke), rabbits turn into money before your eyes, and the floaters come along like ominous clouds and the screen shakes from the force of the breeders.

The bakery brings great quality of life, farmers give all the money you ever want, and on dead lands, moving builders in portals is such bliss. The sight of two ballistas going ham on a cloud of floaters is all a monarch needs to feel like all the running around was worth it. 

ps. my hermits keep hiding in the fields. 

Looking forward to the next great game from these devs

"Pretty much an interactive screensaver. Cool idea with some great execution. Completely unbalanced though; if you lose any of the advanced resources (gems) then youre pretty much screwed on progression and will need to restart with a new save file. Which is just odd for such a simple game. Tweaking shouldnt be too hard, but clearly the publishers are satisfied making $20 per copy of the same exact game over and over again.

If you like pixel-art, then its worth it! Just wait until its on sale... like everything else these days.",True,1689904745
"""It's both relaxing and anxiety-ridden all at the same time - and I love it!!""

This experience is like a roller coaster of emotions, providing moments of relaxation while listening to the lovely soundtrack and exploring the pixel art grandeur with my friends, while also eliciting a sense of anxiety when the gombas (greedies bois) come steal your dog or the town gives you too much coins and your money falls into the water lost for all eternity. 

It's intriguing how this duality can captivate one's senses and keep them engaged throughout. While some may find the mix of emotions overwhelming, I personally find it to be an exciting and unique aspect of the overall experience.

The relaxing parts allow me to unwind and escape from the daily stresses, while the moments of anxiety add an unexpected thrill. It's like a perfect blend of serenity and excitement, creating a memorable and unforgettable journey.

"this game is just boring.

you do nothing except going riding left and right at a sluggish pace, not helped by a ridiculously out of place stamina system for your asthmatic horse, and dropping coins to watch your citizens build the same walls and towers and fight the same type of enemy, which pose no threat whatsoever.

you can't fight, you cant build outside of designated spots, you have 0 freedom on how to approach the world, you can't explore, there is 0 story, 0 dialogue, 0 soundtrack, 0 characters.

all you do is just sit there, with your fingers either pressed the Q or D button, while your citizens do the same repetitive stuff, very slowly.

the game has pretty pixel graphics, though it becomes quite stale after you realize you'll be watching at the same stuff for hours anyway.

not recommended whatsoever unless you like to play games to fall asleep.

oh, I also forgot to mention you can't remap key bindings, nor change the keyboard language layout, which in 2023 is an absolute disgrace, and I fail to see how coop can add anything of value to this game except doubling the amount of players falling asleep.",False,1689774361

"[b][h1]Kingdom Two Crowns is like being transported into an unfamiliar, yet recognizable world.[/h1][/b]

[b][h2]TLDR:[/h2][/b]
Kingdom Two Crowns is not complicated; it’s almost ruthless in its efficiency. The gameplay mirrors your thought process, and your thought process is informed by the way you play. Mechanics and environment go hand in hand, and provide a story that the game never needs to spell out for you. Although the gameplay can be repetitive, if you engage with the mystery of the world you will have fun.

[b][h2]Brief Summary: [/h2][/b]
Purple goopy monsters who are hungry for everything gold attack your village every night. It is up to you as the regent to protect your town and its citizens. Utilizing the left, right, up, and down keys (yes, that’s all you need for gameplay) you learn to distribute resources, hire citizens, and build up defenses against the nightly onslaught of the enemy. This game does not have combat or save slots. There is only an autosave feature. If your defenses fail the purple monsters will ravage the land and its people, and most importantly, they will steal your crown. There is no king without a crown in this game. The next regent (you, but as a new character) will have to restart the process of building a kingdom from the beginning if you are defeated. Winning means stopping the enemy for good.

[b][h2]What It’s Like To Play:[/h2][/b]
Picture this: you’re dropped into the middle of the forest. No, not you, your character. Whoever they are (your royal changes in each life) is on horseback. There’s also a ghost, another once king or queen, with an outstretched arm pointing toward the distance. They simply tell you to follow them. Unsure whether or not to say yes, you hesitantly reach around, tapping the normal buttons for movement on your keyboard. When you hit the right button, the horse moves.  Following this spirit through the forest, you see the husks of two men in rags wandering back and forth. The ghost ushers you forward, encouraging you to give. Through iconography and trial and error you figure out how to give each man a coin, how to give them tools, and, slowly but surely, how to rebuild the kingdom. By the time you have nascent ideas about how to succeed, the spirit disappears, and then you have to figure out everything else on your own. The game explains little, and though the ghost appears to show you how to get where towns used to be every level, much of this game is a mystery that you are in charge of solving.

How you play from that point is up to you. What are these old structures for? What happens if I give to the land? You have to balance your income with your curiosity, figuring out when you can give, what the consequences of giving are, and if you will even get something back. Although the ways to spend coins are often clear through the iconography of the game, how to get coins is a far more mysterious process. Rather than spoil it for you here, I'd suggest keeping your eyes peeled for opportunities to get your coin back, and think logically. For example, if you build a fence in the middle of this field, where will the animals you want to hunt graze.  Keeping your coin purse full becomes even more of a challenge when introduced to the enemies that target the area.

[b][h2] So What?[/h2][/b]
Without any more spoilers, it’s easy to tell people to buy these games. The pixel art is exceptional. I found myself just stopping and staring at the screen, thinking how beautiful this world is. The gameplay is intuitive in some senses and completely a mystery in others. Having the gameplay mechanics inform [i] your tactics [/i] recreates the feelings that you imagine the protagonist should feel. When you don’t know how to play, the protagonist is similarly lost. As you grow more confident in the controls and mechanics, and the character simultaneously moves through spaces with more confidence, the game feels natural. It feels like a story unfolding before your eyes that you can feel and experience with your own emotional reinforcement as you play.
Combat is quite simple in that there isn't any. If your defenses fail and your crown is left vulnerable you die. Your rule ends and the land suffers. There are no retries or second chances for a single player experience. However, with the death of one royal comes another. You have the opportunity to rebuild again.

[b][h2] Rec or No? [/h2][/b]
Beyond good or bad, (and I enthusiastically place Kingdom Two Crowns in the good category) this game is a reminder about studios being intentional in the hows and whys of game creation, and that is always something worth supporting. I wholeheartedly recommend this game!

[b][h1]Kingdom Two Crowns is a reminder that a beautiful game doesn’t need to be overly complicated, or have a novel’s length worth of writing to craft an amazing experience.[/h1][/b]",True,1689221670

"This is one of my favorite games, and I don't say that lightly. I have a very stressful job and K2C has been my go-to for relaxation since I got the game. The pixel graphics are beautiful, the music is really great, and the gameplay is simple but addictive and engaging.

There are several different modes to play. On the surface they look like simple reskins, but the units change and so do the mechanics for each new environment. Every mode--original (which is European), Shogun, Dead Lands, and Norse Lands--has its own unique rules for special units, mounts, and the environment, which makes each one special and fun in its own way.

My personal favorite is Shogun. I love the Japanese theme. The bamboo thickets are fun, plus the ninja are cool to use. Out of the 200+ hours I've played, I think about 3/4ths of that is Shogun. I love getting on my horse and casually roaming through the thicket, strategizing my layout while listening to the shamisen and the birds chirping. It's very relaxing. At night, there's something cathartic about watching an army of ninja jump out of nowhere to flank giant swarms of Greed with swords and shuriken.

I love the simplicity of this game, but also the self-discovery. Aside from a small tutorial in the beginning, the game doesn't overtly tell you what to do or what's awaiting you further in. Experimentation and exploration is a huge draw. New players should really try this on Easy or Normal first. Going any harder might be off-putting since you won't understand how to really play and can get overwhelmed really quickly--especially on Cursed.

Unlike the other games in this series, K2C has co-op, which is great. But I would've liked a matchmaking system. It's hard to find people to play with sometimes since most of my friends don't really like this type of game.

I hope the dev makes more games like this. Out of all the ones in the series, K2C is perfection for me. It'll be hard to top it, but I'd never say ""no"" to more of the same. I wish we could've gotten an expansion for more than just five islands. Or alternatively, I would've loved a customization option to start Cursed on Island 5 with all the upgrades unlocked just so that I could do a marathon run and see how long I can last without having to go through the buildup first.

I've had this game for awhile and I'm only writing this review now because Eighties just came out and I was sadly a little disappointed with that. I just wanted to let the devs know why I loved K2C more.",True,1688797393

"Fun and challenging. Well designed for a game that keeps it simple with 3 (sometimes 4) buttons. Build your kingdom, recruit people to serve, and survive against an endless, ever-increasing tide of monsters that come every night. The game is excellent in its simplicity.

I went somewhat backwards in this series despite getting the first three games in a bundle. The game is difficult, even on easy, due to the fact that while the game teaches you the basics, you're left largely on your own for greater strategy. While in Kingdom Eighties, this wasn't an issue, it is here. It largely boils down to time. 

You can build comfortably pretty easily, but as the days tick by in game, the enemy gets stronger and more numerous. It can look like you clear a stage and move on (as it is in Eighties) and how I initially took it, but instead it's more like you have to move between five different lands to acquire what you need to ultimately conquer them all. As a result, moving between them quickly is paramount and failure to do so is punishing. You can end up in an untenable situation without realizing it.

Speed is also emphasized by the fact the islands gets bigger, increasing the amount of land left and right you have to traverse. Your main mode of transport is a mount that can tire and need rest. Mounts can graze on grass to recover stamina faster, but only if you park over grass (and forget about it in winter). More mounts can be found with differing stats which is interesting, but also highlights the main double edged sword that's both the game's greatest strength and greatest flaw.

It can be a lot of in depth strategy to think about where you need to go, when you need to get there, and plan several moves in advance. Did you bring enough with you to set up in the next area? On the downside, because speed is so essential in the game, the various mount options (and alternate characters in the Dead Lands expansion) are virtually pointless. Just get whoever makes you fastest and never change. Despite the time pressure adding a lot of strategic thinking, tactically, it's limiting. Once you know what to do, it's just do that, but faster. 

Despite that, I still enjoy the game. It would be nice if they could tweak the lower difficulties at least to not make things so dependent on speed. Maybe give players more time to set up in a new land on easier modes besides peaceful so players can get the full experience, but in a more flexible manner.",True,1688756738

"This game is extremely well made. It is extremely underrated. You get to build your kingdom up, hire people, gain money, and a lot more things to do. Though be careful, the greed come out at night. The greed basically attack your kingdom, aiming for one thing: Your Crown.

For an 8-bit game, the graphics are not too bad either. Devs put a lot of effort into the water though. Making it reflect what is on the surface, such as your character and your kingdom. 

There are various mounts in this game. There is the griffin, which knocks back the greed from you and is very quick. There is the lizard, which shoots fire, but does not have much stamina compared to the griffin. The default mount is the horse.

The soundtrack is very well made too, my point cannot be changed about that. 😂

- Just a note to anyone looking at buying the earlier two games, they are basically the same but with less features. You can buy them if you want to support the devs, but don't buy them for more content.",True,1688200242
"Interesting.

First I bought this opus because a review was saying it was solving some flaws from a previous one I started.
The reality is no. It does not. They are exactly the same with perhaps a bit more of content for this one. I would then recommend to buy only this last if you are interested in trying the series.

The flaws are mainly some actions that requires pressing a key or the button of your pad much more than it should be necessary. No big deals but a bit tedious. Another one is, to move from one map to another, you need to restore a ship. Every time you arrive in a map for which you did not secure a certain place, the ship is destroyed. Guess what, the most tedious part of clicking is when you build this boat... Travelling between the maps is more than necessary.

The game itself is quite interesting for the first hours. Very simple to play. 3 directions. 2 buttons. The mechanic is interesting in that way. Casual, simple, yet not simplistic.
You recruit beggars, give them a role, they build your camp, make it grow and support waves of monsters trying to destroy your monarchy by killing them.
You then explore this horizontally scrolled map for potential benefits including some sorts of secrets or events. They are not really secrets. They requires you to potentially explore a map and come back to a previous one with what is necessary to activate the covet.
You expand your domain till you arrive to destroy all the sources of monsters per maps.

Visuals are enjoyable. Music are really pleasant. Sounds are fine.

A point come where you have achieved your extension enough to not risk to be demolished. Your kingdom is prosperous enough but you still need to extend to destroy the portals from where the monsters arise. So, comes the grinding. You know it is going to take some time.
This is where I am done myself. Nothing else to explore. A mechanic that is well understood. Just a job that remains to be finished for probably some hours more. Since it is some of my leisure time, I leave the job.

If you like this, there is then replayability. It seems to include different universe as well like a medial japan and some more. I did not try this yet. I may, but later. Hoping for something new to discover that does not limit to visuals. If not, I will drop it.

Overall, the game is good. Nice to play.  Especially if you are fine with the grindy part.",True,1688193678

Every dlc this game has is practically an entire new game in itself. Its worth the price. Great game solo and with friends.

"This game, like its predecessors, is magical. There are a lot of UI and clarity things that I think have been unaddressed since the original Kingdom and do negatively impact the experience, but other than that I think this game is nearly perfect.

At face value the strategic depth of the game may seem lacking compared to other RTS or tower defense games. However, this game is so much less about mechanics than it is vibes. Look at it, it's gorgeous! And the soundtrack is probably my favorite of any game ever. Despite the flagrant overuse of the term, I think it might be the most ""immersive"" game I've ever played in that I could probably sit in a dark room for 24 hours playing this game and not even realize how much time had passed in the outside world (and that's in-spite of full day-night and seasonal cycles in-game).

Kingdom: Two Crowns also has one really notable trait due to its simplicity, vibes, and notably it's multiplayer: It is the perfect co-op game to play with a non-gamer. My girlfriend has bounced-off of numerous co-op platformers, beat-em-ups, and strategy games over the years. Prior to Two Crowns, the only games I'd gotten her to try that she genuinely enjoyed were Bloons Tower Defense 6 and a few Pokémon games. However, we started a new Two Crowns game at like 8pm one night and played straight through until like 8am. It was such a great experience and a lifelong memory for both of us. It's been like 3 years since then and I still think about it a lot.

Sadly, I think the game's replayability is relatively low despite the new content that's been introduced, especially if you've played the previous games in the franchise. It's a solid improvement over its predecessors and the DLCs add some fun variety, but without a UI or core gameplay overhaul, it still feels like fundamentally the same game with some multiplayer added-in. That's not to say it's not worth the money, you will definitely get a lot of value for your time and the game will suck you in for at least a few hours, but if you're like me, once you've played the game through to completion, you'll probably be done with it.

All of that said, I think everyone should at least try a Kingdom game (and why not the newest and best?) and play it long enough to hear all of the songs on the soundtrack and see a few seasonal cycles. It's an absolutely beautiful experience.",True,1686730273

"I absolutely love this game.
I picked up Kingdom: Two Crowns a while back, needing something light weight enough that I could multitask with, and didn't expect to fall as hard as I did with it. 
Art: 10/10, anyone who loves pixel graphics as I do will be utterly charmed.
Sound Design: 9/10 I love the soundscape, the music is just on the edge of being lo-fi, and thus is naturally pretty calming, without being distracting. The different effects you'll hear from dropping coins, to shooting arrows, to the gentle huff-huff-huff of your stead are utterly satisfying. You may not come away with an ear worm, but whenever you pick up the game, especially after a long time away, you'll find yourself comforted-- kind of like drinking hot cocoa right when winter finally hits.
Story: 10*/10. Not much to go on here, really. You play as a ruler, or rulers, trying to defend your crown by building up different settlements on islands from an inky, dark scourge of monsters. Each island has different puzzles/people/creatures to stumble across, and that sort of adds some flavor to the locations. Now, switching between campaigns, the skins change pretty radically, and that can be really refreshing. It's hard to give this one a low score, because the game isn't here to present a sweeping epic with a dozen different named characters beholden to rich but angst filled backstories. And that's okay, because it's really not necessary. 
Game play:  5/10-8/10 Here's where some people might find some friction, hence the weird rating I gave it. The islands are small, yes. As a ruler all you /really/ do is drop coin and run. Most of your job is going back and forth, strategically deciding on how to use that coin, and when. There's a short night/day cycle you're going to want to pay attention to, because night is when the baddies come out, and your little guys, for the most part-can only take a hit before they drop their sh*t. Villagers don't die, you can always pay to get them back again, but when you leave an island there's a high chance that when you go back you'll find that the reset button has been hit. Although the islands have their own puzzles and difficulty levels, and you are one thousand percent going to have to go back and forth to unlock everything, it's worth it...though, yes, repetitive. For me, this is kind of the game I needed as it doesn't require 100% of my focus, so that's all fine. Really the only complaint I have is that once you set to building something it's going to be built, you can't change your mind, though it will possibly be gone the next time you return to the island because, well, monsters.  
Multiplayer: ?/10. Haven't touched it, so I can't give a good answer. I hear it's great though, so I'm guessing it scales pretty well. But despite the Two Crowns in the game, the game plays pretty solid in solo.

tl;dr: I love this game, and it's a vast improvement on the last. If it's on sale, holy cow do you have a deal. If it's not, it's pretty cheap overall. For it's price, you're not losing out, imo.

General tips:
-Take your time in expanding. Go too fast, and the land is going to get angry, worsening the power of the monster scourge. 
-Invest. When you get a big enough base, you can stuff that bad boy with gold, and it'll pay for itself. You go back later and you'll have some coin to work with if things have gone south.
-What's the word? You can't attack animals, but you can scare them towards your boys. 
-Don't get greedy. If you check up on your guys and they start throwing cash, your bag will overfill and the extra might be lost in the water. They'll keep the coin in the meantime otherwise, don't worry.
-If the monsters attack you, attack back...with coin. There are multiple things in this game that basically slap you in the face with the ""don't be greedy"" tag, and this one is another. Get scared? Throw gold, they horde it like the villagers do.
-Mind the time. If you're building a wall be mindful of where your archers are, and how far your builders are from safety. Once it's up, your archers will expand their walking grounds, but they will only head to the post of a completed wall. You don't want your archers to be half way across the map while you're trying to finish a wall just before sunset, otherwise the monsters are going to get there first, destroy the undefended wall, and leave anyone there that can't swing a sword vulnerable. 
-You can build on the other side of forests. This may take a minute to suss out, but it's possible, and I feel like--this may just be me-- it makes expanding a little less strenuous on the land. 
-Try to take your hermits when you move. They can get on the boat, too. Along with archers, builders, and even knights. Don't leave your old place too unguarded, but your hermits can't do their jobs if they're in a different castle--sorry, on a different island.
-Maybe buy this on Switch. Or, better yet, get the Deck. I have a feeling this will be Perfection on a grab and go device.",True,1686161090

"The prettiest, most charming, but also relaxing pixel art on steam.",True,1685484015
"I'm in love, from the minimalist approach to base building and strategy to the soundtrack, ambient audio and gorgeous pixel art which has made possibly the best use of parallax layering and shaders I've ever seen -- the time of day, weather and seasonal effects are so vast and varied and the transitions from one to the next are the smoothest thing.

If you're looking for a calm, relaxing and satisfying experience please look no further. There is plenty of content here to keep you satisfied, I'm 12 hours in and still haven't finished campaign 1 of 4 -- let alone co-op.

If you're someone looking for a strategy experience with depth, automation, tactical commands or any sort of delineated gameplay, you should look elsewhere to be quite honest.

This is a simple game, it refuses to give on that principal if it means having so much as one user interface beyond the main menu. Player actions are limited to moving across the island, stopping in front of villagers to collect any coins they've accrued, and spending said coins on more villagers, specific tools to take place as jobs for said villagers, or buildings and improvements to those buildings (and you don't get to decide where buildings can be placed either, there are predetermined locations that you can spend coins on and your workers will build those up however many times you want to upgrade).

There's a bit of added depth with gems, which are rare, but after some hard work to get them you are rewarded with mounts as well as NPCs or buildings that grant access to new materials and upgrades to further fortify your settlement. It's a rewarding yet simple gameplay loop.

"Unlike a lot of other negative reviews, I wouldn't say that I found the game boring.  What you get in the beginning is intriguing - build up a little kingdom, probably build a boat because you're just throwing coins at each new thing, see extra icons in the island maps and figure ""oh, I should probably see what's further out"" and then start fighting back.  I don't mind the exploration through trial and error approach.  It could be better, but it's okay.
So, why the negative reivew?  Bascially because the AI is horrible and all it does it cost you far too much time.  Exploring and building up is okay, but spending 5 minutes at a time running back and forth to re-supply a few minions, send them off on another attack run, and then watch as they instantly biff it is an unreasonable waste of time.  What's worse is that because this is a game of minimal explanation and much exploration, you'll have no idea if this is your fault or the game bugging out.  I repeated this process a few times, and that's more chances than the game deserved.

I totally love the game. It's a hidden gem. It's beautiful and minimalistic, with a great soundtrack. HOWEVER, I think it's lacking a few things to be perfect (like a villager count on one side of the screen, with each profession), and I do not understand the huge difficulty increase towards the end of the game. I do not. I mean.... I understand that difficulty increases as you progress, and a bit more so if you manage to not lose your crown, but man... a friend and I burst the Greed on 2 islands, and as we arrived on the 3rd, this massive, impossible wave of enemies came every single night. We tanked for a few nights, which included a Bloodmoon, and found out that we had no Truce after that Bloodmoon either. It was freaking insane, and totally impossible to advance. It was not fun. Dunno if it was a bug or something, but we barely had time to recover ourselves and attack the big portal, since enemies spawned so quick as well. I absolutely recommend the game, though.

[b]DLC-Only achievements:[/b] Yes, The DLCs are needed for the achievements. 2 of them are free on Steam but the Norse lands is a paid DLC

This review has a long time been in the making. I adore this game, it is so much fun and I have even played through it with multiple friends. Then why did this review take so long you ask? Because I like to review my games after getting all the achievements and this game has 1 very challenging achievement and one very grindy achievement. The grindy one I could have get a long time ago, but what is the point if you know that there is this one achievement I wouldn't be able to get? Well, that changed yesterday when I found out there were tricks that felt very counterintuitive but worked well and that way it would only take around 4/5h to be able to get it. 

However, let's start with why I like this game. Kingdom Two Crowns is one of those games in which you give tasks to people but do not directly control them, and in my opinion, this is one of the bests in that genre. You have to build up and mostly defend your kingdom. Find the right things to in the end be able to beat the evil, in this case, ""the greed"".  It is so fun to be able to make decisions but have to keep in mind that you want to keep your people safe... build a new wall a bit further..? Do you workers have time for that during this day or should you wait a day? New workers.. which job do you give them? What is needed the most? The game works really well and looks beautiful! It is also awesome it has different campaigns to change things up a bit in case you like to play multiple times through it. 

And to make this game extra special, you can also play with a friend, this is possible locally but also over the Internet. And it doesn't matter if they own the game or not, as the ""remote play together"" function on Steam works really well. You don't get more resources in multiplayer so you have to communicate what to do next so that you have enough workers as well as resources and keep an eye out for the timing of things. what will help is that when you switch to another island, you both can have a bag full of coins and in this way take extras to your next island to make the start quicker. 

One of the things that I didn't like is that not much is explained in the game. There is this ghost that will sometimes point things about, but a lot is figuring it out yourself.. or most of the time ""check the wiki"". Activating a statue that shows clearly an archer, but what does it really do? Check the wiki! Found a new mount, but should you really switch to it, what is its unique ability? Check out the wiki. It is awesome that there is so much going on, but having to check the internet to figure out what it does, or why you want to do it or maybe not want to do something.. check out that same wiki again. I wish that was handled in another way. It is nice to not be stuck in tutorial land for hours, but there is a fine line between explaining stuff and explaining almost nothing. 

Another thing of which I'm not a fan of was winter... I hate it in real life and I'm glad we're kinda past that season at the moment of writing this, but in this game, it can also be very boring. It is so much harder to make money during this season and money is needed for everything! A year in-game takes 64 days and from day 48 to 64 it is winter, which makes sense as it is 1/4 of the in-game year. But that are a lot of days of kinda just waiting to be passed so you can keep going with improving your kingdom. It even sucks more if you just switched to a new island before the winter and then have to build up while not being able to generate money easily. In my last playthrough, I decided when winter started that I could clean my kitchen and hopefully the winter has passed when I came back to my pc. 

Back to those achievements, as I love to hunt down achievements and complete my games that way. Kingdom Two Crown has DLC achievements. Those I haven't unlocked yet because I'll buy the DLC in the future, but I know I'll love it as it is more of the same good stuff and sprinkled with more thematic stuff and extras. But the base game has a lot of nice and very doable achievements. some you have to directly go for (like kill no enemy for 5 days), but most of them you'll unlock by just playing through the game. It has 1 a 2 grindy ones, sailing between 2 islands in coop mode 30 times, this can easily be done solo but by activating the multiplayer local mode. Have the lighthouse on two islands and just sail between the two of them. The most grindy one is the one for retrieving your crown 300 times.  Then there is a very challenging achievement for completing the game in one reign, one reign means you never lost your crown. which is in a normal playthrough is so very challenging because the longer you play without losing your crown the harder the monsters will get. Lose your crown and you get back to an earlier island but most of all the calendar is reset back to day 1. 

After researching about that achievement again yesterday, as I have done in the past but that was a long time ago, I learned that there are tricks to make this very doable. For one, you can play on the easy difficulty. They added the difficulty settings later on but this makes it a lot better. And the second thing is knowing that when you destroy portals the enemies become stronger. I followed the plan of some speedrunners which basically was only to build what you need, never expand your base and don;''t waste time and resources on destroying the portal at the port side. Go from islands 1 to 2, back to 1, 3 and 4 and at 4 build up your base to max level and destroy the cave portal, then island 5 the same and destroy the cave portal, same on island 1, 2 and last on island 3. |Getting money quickly was important but I didn't use any farms as that would take time and you need to expand your base. The following video explains it in more detail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_w9oeGArIk

Turn the music to 0 (respectfully).  This game is proper minimalist strategy and offers hours of replay-ability.  It gives a great sense of progression despite having perma-death.  It offers a sense of mystique on every island where the player can discover something new, or revisit an island with new skills or resources.  The balance of persistence is wonderfully executed, you likely won't 'unlock' 100% of any island your first playthrough.  Most of all, the IMMERSION of complementary VFX + SFX makes it incredibly easy to get lost in this world.  
[hr][/hr]
Gameplay tip: when your bannermen are leading a charge, you can drop coins at their feet to 'heal' them as enemies hit them, making them last longer in battle ;).
[hr][/hr]
QOL request to devs: Please lower the blood moon sfx and similar growling noises.  I play with music on 0 and it's disproportionately loud compared to any other sound effect.  I understand it should be scary but..too much, IMO.
[hr][/hr]
QOL request: Please offer a better way to collect coins, or simply increase the area coins are 'magnetized' into the player's pouch.  When walking regularly regardless of animal, many coins are missed because an NPC is too late to drop the coins, throws them the other direction, or another reason that requires the player to double-back and retrieve them.  Kinda a PITA.
[hr][/hr]
QOL request: would be neat if the villagers helped keep coffers full by dropping held money at x person's feet, instead of just the queen.

QOL request: I don't want this dog.  Really, them barking destroys my immersion.  YMMV, maybe I haven't discovered how to 'use' it yet.

"This isn't a game for me. 

It's a mobile port, so understandably its simple. But I for the life of me cannot enjoy this gameplay loop. I enjoyed the initial exploration of the game as I tried to figure out how to progress without hand-holding tutorials, but once I got past that I realized the game is excepetionally easy, even on the hardest difficulty. It consists of you running around picking up homeless people to work endlessly for a single gold coin, while using the fruits of their labor to build your kingdom up. You then hire more people to defend your kindgom against the faceless greed, who will steal your dog and coins and crown. Its a cool concept, but I got very bored pretty quickly after beating the game. 

The main loop consists of running around during the day and hiring people, then upgrading or building new walls and archer towers to fight off the greed. Then, you sit and watch your archers either kill them all or get massacred. There are hectic moments as you retreat to your backup walls, but you have so little agency it infuriates me. The best strategy is just to tech up ASAP and just slowly push towards the greed stronghold. Its not hard but super grindy. On top of that, the soundtrack is truly aggravating. I hate hearing the dodo-bird sounding woodwind instrument popping up and down like an oompa loompa, and I hate this game. I was planning on 100% it, but I'm not sure since there is paid DLC and I don't want to play this game anymore. Though its relaxing and fun to see your kingdom grow, the actual growth process is tedious and never really expanded upon that much. 

Not worth a single cent imo. If you are a super casual strategy gamer, this might be a really great choice for you. I personally cannot find it within me to enjoy this.",False,1682271613

"There's no meaningful tutorial past the first 5% of the game. The concept of ""drop coins everywhere and see what happens"" feels not good.

I got to the final level of the campaign before unlocking a key technology because it was not clear what had to be done to get stone. I had no idea that you could actually take the fight to the baddies until I went down a wiki rabbit hole.

A good chunk of the end-game achievements are missable just due to the seeds that generate the islands, and that feels really bad. Many of the challenge map seeds I've tried to play are frankly not possible to survive the first night.

"I think my experience boils down to but a few points.

The islands are so wide that it takes you ages to get anywhere, which sucks cause it's a management game. You don't have to be there for things to happen, only set them in motion.
Many things that could have slight automation (such as generating population) are manual and stay that way. Meaning every single person you add to your ranks has to be recruited by you personally.
The pace in the beginning is wonderfully slow as you discover how it all works, but the thing is, this never changes. Spending your coins will always take arduously long. Running from place to place gets slightly faster with different rides, but the islands are so huge and you have to manually do everything, so the difference falls short. 
Personally I would love to know how many villagers I have. How many more farmers I have space for. Be able to take these damn soldiers out of this boat, so they can actually do something. The fact you can't recall them, after never explaining they would irrevocably be put in the boat if I rang the bell.
Also, no V-sync, so the entire playthrough my screen was torn in half (tried all the zoom levels and I'm using a 3060).

"My current 'tism obsession, i think I gave another 200 hours on my mates steam account that I borrow sometimes. It's a really chill strategy game and I really enjoy casually playing through it. Would recommend new players look at the wiki especially the page on islands as the community is really good for keeping them updated and it'll give you an idea of what to expect. The premise of the game is you're a monarch (chose masc fem or neutral by pressing down during the first loading screen) and you travel island to island building your 2d civilisation while every night you're hit by waves of monsters (greed.) Beginners will see a campaign last about 10 hours but after a while it'll be about 3-4. I especially love the Norse dlc- The loki puzzle and subsequent ability to shape shift is just the coolest but I think I spend most my time with the Hel ability to summon the dead. Also I love that you can just have a pet dog that follows you around in every version of the game (Warning it can be stolen by the  greed and you'll have to destroy the big cave - need ton of upgrades- to get the dog back)
My current obsession is definitely the challenge islands though. I just completed Skull island for the first time after practising loads in the brand new lost islands. I think the randomisation on lost islands could be looked at cause I have been getting almost the same island each day this week which kinda ruins the novelty of it.

Anyway there's so much good content I would 100% recommend. My only issue with this game is that if you develop a deep hyper fixation that you have to keep a careful lid on so it doesn't take over your life is that there's f*** all merch. I think there's some bot generated stuff but it kinda sucks.",True,1680738378

"Rating 9/10

Overall, this game checks all the boxes for me. Interesting story and progression. Mechanics are enough to not get bored. Plus the developers are always pumping out contact. When the first kingdom came out I thought it was solid but lacked an end goal. Now with two crowns and new lands. There is more enjoyment in replaying the game and finally closing the book on the journey. Now the reason for the 9 is because its a tad slow in the beginning and for me I enjoy a slow burn but I know others might try to rush to island 4. Leading to a tough hole to climb out of. Again highly recommend for such a cheap game, only thing missing now is maybe a community made feature where people can create islands with certain challenges to overcome.

"Certainly, this is a fun game! More fun that I thought it would be when I first learned the controls were only  3 buttons. 

I do have my issues with it of course, but all little nitpicks after playing for as long as I have. 

Nitpick: 

1. I would like to be able to change the controls for this game, unfortunately you are unable to. This is an issue because I have no earthly idea on how to use some mounts abilities. I should have to use a different controller. My keyboard should be just fine. i have had the griffin for about 6 hours and I still have no clue how to use his affect to push enemies. I had the dragon/giant lizard at one point and I couldn't figure out how to make him breathe fire. I had the bear, and I couldn't use his attack. 

2. I also dislike that the money bag is far too small. It easily can be overfilled and you're forced to either avoid your kingdom's workers (MUCH easier said than done sometimes) or waste it. And when it comes to wasting it you have two options: you can either let it just fall out of your bag while you run from the kingdom workers to search for a place to use them, or you let them hit the water. I just think a king should have bigger money bags, or more. Even one more bag would be helpful. Or make it related to the mounts. If I manage to survive long enough to find another than a horse mount at least gift me a slightly bigger bag because the mount can hold more. Or make it so the higher the level of my kingdom the more money I can hold. Or allow a bank to be built. 

3. One more button, maybe a cancel button? I've built far too many walls trying to give gold to an npc or something else. I would love to be able to demolish a building or a wall I no longer need.

4. An almanac for the enemies and friends you've made! Give me the lore behind EVERYTHING!

5. (this is me assuming I've done everything the game has to offer, I doubt it but I feel like I have obtained every mount and every hermit) more upgrades! Okay, we got the metal wall, can we make a spiked wall? Or a wall that has its own towers in it?

6. The workers don't fill all spaces that are empty within the walls. I would like to have all of the towers I've upgraded filled with units. Or every farm I've built in the wall filled. The works usually go to wherever is closest to them. which is only an issue because again they do not always fill up spaces like - I think - they should.


Again, all of these are my nitpicks. I think the game is fun and has nice music. I can - and have- pulled multiple all nighters just playing this game. As a person that HIGHLY loves Age of Empires II: Age of Kings Definitive Edition, I recommend this game to people that like resource management but want to do more chilling than micromanaging. 

Love the game! That ""hours played"" will only grow.",True,1679956967

"I've been playing since Kingdom Classic, and New Lands. I think this is a great iteration, and I'm glad they're continuing to add new content and variations. I hope they continue to add DLC. The differences between Shogun and Norse are slight, I wouldn't necessarily pay for the Norse DLC again, but I hope that the game can become even more evolved in time, it's come really far from the original game. But it's still simple, and fun. This newest feature of Lost Islands has been a nice way to play a bit more with daily different islands, but I hope they can create more islands, more jobs, or maybe some other types of Greeds to make it more challenging.

"oh boy, esse jogo me pego desprevenido não vo menti
eu ja conhecia a franquia Kingdom a um tempo ja, lembro de ve uns videos do new lands la pra 2014-15, mas na epoca eu era burro e não entendi muito do jogo, por isso caguei, dps de MT tempo eu peguei o mesmo na epic games quando ele fico de graça... nunca joguei, foi quando eu lembrei que esse jogo existia quando eu tava olhando a playstore do meu celular pra acha alguma merda pra passa o tempo, baxei o jogo, joguei, e eu joguei pra krl, puta que pariu eu amei esse jogo, agora que eu tenho uma noção melhor de jogos eu entendi oq era esse jogo, e eu adorei ele, resultado? comprei ele na steam ué, como q eu to esquevendo isso mongol
any way...
Kingdom: Two Crowns é o terceiro jogo da franquia Kingom, sendo o segundo a ser mais que 0 reais
KTC é uma especie de tower defence, com uma pegada meio q roguelike? eu axo, sei la
uma das mecanicas principais é o sistema de morte no jogo, que, quando você morre, não é bem o fim, você não reseta o jogo, ele volta daonde vc paro, só cm algumas coisas pra arruma, um herdeiro, por assim dizer, fazendo com que toda vez que vc morra, você não tenha que começar da estaca zero, assim n fica chato tlg
outra coisa que eu achei legal, mas é meio irritante, só um poco, é que no jogo tu não é um deus que tem uma vizão de tudo que acontece sempre, tu é um random num cavalo, tu tem que anda até os lugares, sem fast travel (no começo pelo menos) e nem pausa no tempo pra olha as coisa, o unico jeito de para o tempo é pausando o jogo memo, e eu achei isso legal, só é irritante por causa da stamina, mai ai é de cada um

por mais que esse jogo não seja a praia de todo mundo, eu absolutamente recomendo ao menos tentarem ele, principalmente por causa do coop, pois é um jogo incrivel, tanto graficamente quanto em jogabilidade, pode ser meio complexo no começo, poh eu tenho no maximo 7hrs de jogo total, eu ainda sofro pra sabe algumas coisa, mai memo assim, ele é um jogo incrivel e é bem interessante de se aprende as coisa, ja que sem um guia, tu aprende na base do erro memo

"Very little content, 0 explanation in game. At first it was cute, the first NPC is pretty obvious what it does, but then I just kept trying to use NPCs and never got any queues on what to do with them. So guide is required.

I think I gimped myself by destroying too many portals on the early islands, on island 4 a portal was so close I couldn't get spearmen, so very little defense, and on day XXII the counter attack for killing that portal was tons of monsters that rampaged my base with little I could do since the spearmen from one side won't go the other side for some reason.

There are seasons, first try I reached 3rd island by winter. So I arrived on the island, got 0 income and monsters keep getting  stronger. Advice is to stay on developed island during winter, meanwhile you will still have the issue of stronger monsters on the next island when you eventually get there, with 0 defense. Best method is to suicide, and come back by spring on the new island. But why have winter at all then. Winter lasts a full hour when you're not supposed to do anything btw...

So the game is full of weird mechanics like that that don't really fit together. You have very little control on the units. It takes a whole in-game day to gather your units to go to the next island since you have to wait for them to walk across the map at walking pace (why would they run, right?), etc etc...

I did not have fun after the first 5 hours and progress became simply tedious. Reading guides made me feel I didn't really miss anything, it's just that kind of game.",False,1679209176

"The game has  many mechanics to hinder your progress and a severe lack of quality of life features. It is a pity because the pixel art is superb and I loved the game concept.

Let me give you a few examples.

1. It is easy to ruin your run, but you can only have one save.

2. Do you want to save your coins? Fine, but your purse's coin capacity is capped so if you fill it too much your coins will drop to the ocean. Obviously this is by design, the dev does not want you to plan ahead, farm gold and then move forward with that net safety. Is all this really necessary? Why not allow the player to have fun instead? You cannot even know how many coins are in your bag at a given time unless you throw them on the floor and count them

3. Your horse gets tired quite frequently and once he does he needs to rest for a while. For a game where you need to travel a lot and be in constant movement this becomes an issue. To be fair there is a better horse in the second island but it does not pass within runs even if you expend diamonds to unlock it... I would probably keep playing the game only if that horse passed within runs.

4. The merchant, an important source of income in the earlier game, needs to be paid a coin for each travel. That is fine but...

 a. Sometimes the option to give him the coin is bugged as it overlaps with the option to upgrade your base.

 b. If you die on the second island before giving him the coin then he will be stuck there until you come back. Once you die you restart with a new king/queen in the first island again so now you will need to play without the merchant until you reach the second island again.

c. Other times the merchant just does not appear anymore and you have no idea why.

5. Game mechanics are not explained anywhere. The developer's aim is that you discover it yourself and figure it out, I get it... But this was taken to the extreme, unnecessarily. Good luck looking at the island maps and understanding anything. I upgraded my base on the first island many times but I have no idea what each upgrade did. You are pretty much forced to learn how the game mechanics work by checking Fandom or looking for posts in Reddit.

6. If you die and lose a run then you re-spawn with a new king/queen in the first island and luckily all your buildings are still there (aleluya!) but you need to rebuild your walls and rehire your workers. This is probably the less severe issue in the list but still another mechanic that I found annoying.


I had some of these issues also in the previous games but I did not play them for long. Being this the third game in the series, I hoped for improvements but they were nowhere to be found.


In the end even if I loved the idea I could not cope with these shortcomings that made the game annoying. A pity.
The dev is releasing the fourth iteration of this, clearly successful series, later this year; I can only hope they will at least give some thoughts to address some of the issues I listed.",False,1678814099
"Absolutely worth it if you love building and fighting. A couple things i find annoying is that you cannot use the mouse to select things in the game, it confused me at first but I got the hang of not using it and now i love it. Another thing is that you cannot jump or use the space bar when riding a mount. 
Found a couple bugs, for instance, the builders will not build what i have requested to build, something wont let me assign a second squad to send out to attack.

So worth it! I spent all day playing this game. Although, I do recommend waiting for a discount to purchase.

There is literally no explanation of nothing, which is totally OK for me if the game reads well, what it doesn't to me. You can come in situations where the game is only pain. For example travelling to the second island with no money and people will end the game for you since you will not generate enough income to survive. You will die slowly, having the feeling of being absolutely helpless since enemies will destroy overnight everything plus a bit what you build over the day. this game kept me frustrated.

The pacing is consistent. The various mounts are fun to try. The difficulty starts out very chill, but ramps up nicely.

The presentation may be minimalistic, but I still think there's a noticeable lack of information ([i]leading to a few mechanics that I found to be mildly confusing, until I had checked a wiki for clarification[/i]).

The parallax scrolling is always a bit jerky, which bothers me. You can't disable or reduce the screen shake effect, but at least they rarely use it.

Overall, it could use some polishing up, but I'd say it's definitely worth your time on sale. I'm amazed at how much fun it is to explore both the environment and the game's various features, given how simple it appears to be on the surface.

"Really nice. Really simple. I think this is a good and easy introduction to people who are interested in basebuilding games but feel abit intimidated with the wide variety. Or people who need something to get endlessly invested in that is not a crappy phonegame. 

It can honestly not get more straight forward. Theres basically only three buttons. Left, Right, and throwing money at things/people. 

Played both basegame and Norse DLC. The Norse DLC does definetely polish up certain functions abit more imo and makes it abit smoother to play. However learning the initial mechanics might be easier if you play basegame first. 
Higher levels can get stressful when youre one player as you cannot see whats happening on the other side of your base. But to counteract that when you're two people each with one side of the kingdom it becomes very exciting. I'm so happy this game has local co-op. 

The only truly negative thing is that there aren't mods for this game. I think that's a definitive loss as it would be very suited for a large modding community. The free DLC's Shogun and Deadlands does add a littlebit of flavour but it would be far better with the freedom to go all out.",True,1678143576

"It's not a bad game.

I like slow games. I played stardew, other farming simulators and tycoon games. And I think this game (without DLCs, I didn't tried them) drags on for too long without showing you why should you keep playing. I can motivate myself with clean and good looking aesthetic or ""I still didn't explore *that*"" mentality but cmon, after 7 hours of defending from a same two types of enemies I finally can see where and how I can progress. Still can't really recommend it, I think there are better games in this genre, I will update my review once I'm gonna bring myself to play this game again.

Graphics are good, gameplay loop is meh (just watch youtube videos while you play idk, not a good sign but even with some rouglikes it is a case so whatever) and just try to focus on exploring the game - maybe you will find it more fun then I did.

In fact there is no GUI (other than you physical money sack), everything you need to know are observed audiovisually. Everything that can be integrated for storytelling is integrated. The game doesn't tell you anything, you gotta figure it all out by yourself. It's incredibly difficult on easy, for the first 50 hours I was constantly editing the savefile just enough to stay alive, until I figured out things like how the knights are created, and that the game isn't actually permadeath. I thought the wall sigils were buffs or something and that every time I died the game loaded an older save slot of mine or something and I just restarted, It didn't occur to me that it was an other ruler in a decayed town in the same game.

As such, I'm storing it aside and hiding it in the corner not to be seen again - but before I do that, I'll leave a quick review as my last words of goodbye to a game I once enjoyed playing with someone I spent most of my days with, and had them constantly in my thoughts.

A simple strategy-defense game, this current title of Kingdom allows you to play with a friend either locally or over the world. Do not worry - if one of you loses their crown, the other one will be able to retrieve it back by buying a new one.

Unlike the previous titles, which sent you an endless waves of monsters called Greed that you could never defeat, you are no longer bound to an eternal winter where you either fall slowly to a certain doom or escape to another Island to repeat the cycle. No, now you have fighting chance!

Build, expand, defend, [b]reconquer[/b].

Where each Kingdom title so far had these 3 first instructions, Two Crowns should add ""reconquer"" as you can finally put an end to the Greed and save your kingdom.

Two Crowns allows you long term survivability and the ability to enter the portal and fight back the Greed. Winter no longer lasts forever, and you can survive it by collecting berries.

At first, you won't be able to destroy the portals as you'll need to discover new 'technologies' and gain the ability to recruit armies and build catapults. 

Only around the third Island is when you finally get a proper chance to get back at the Greed. Open your map, return to your old castles, and finish the fight.

While my kingdom slowly deteriorates and crumble, I hope your's will grow and evolve. Just remember to leave some forest for the deer to enjoy running freely, after all you can include them within your walls =)",True,1677077008

Naturally, still works well solo; as more content for Kingdom is more crack for those of us that like to suffer (in a chill way).

It also fixes pretty much the only issue i had with any kingdom games - the eventual lack of content. There are so many new mounts, structures, entire new mechanics and DLCs while still keeping the core gameplay created in Kingdom:Classic.

"The game is screwing with the player on way too many occassions.

While the basic idea is really really good and very fun in local coop, its once again the details that fail to turn potential into quality.

in 80% of cases smt fails because the friendly NPCs act like ... well NPCs without a brain.
they dont properly guard, they miss more then hitting, they love to do the exact less effective thing, run into the wrong direction, etc etc.

most of these are circumventable, even if that is insanely annoying.
but with 2 you cant:
- when you upgrade walls, you loose the area.
your soldiers are not ok with defending the area until the builder upgraded the wall. in fact the existing wall looses its entire effect while its being upgraded. (which can take ages due to AI stupidity)
- when you carry the bomb inside the cave, you need at least 5 coins to trigger the bomb.
when you get hit, you loose money. you fall under 5 coins? well, you cant event finish the cave anymore.
without a way to farm coins from the endlessly spawning mobs you are simply unable to finish. which of course does not change the fact, that when you leave the area, even when everything is well guarded and your soldiers HAVE TO fight without you in the first place,you have to build the bomb agian, carry it to the cave and do it ll again from the start.

jeah no. this is obviously intentionally designed this way.

the game is not difficult, has a nice progression curve. the game can be beaten by figuring stuff out simply by observing. well done so far.

"The first 2 hours of Kingdom Two Crowns are marked by waiting. Perhaps I was playing the game wrong, but the meek tutorial ghost disappeared after letting me know that I can buy archers and builders. The game tells you to explore, but it punishes you because you can't outrun the enemy on your starting mount, so you lose more gold or the precious few gems you collected which might do... something? I activated a shrine holding a sickle, which would have probably buffed by farmers on that island, except I didn't have farmers on island 2, which I didn't know I would be stuck on, since everyone lost their jobs and some ground every night to the increased horde size, and it was all I could do to replace them and try to build a little more towards the farming area. Since I had already collected the chests on the island, there was nothing to do but sit around while workers chopped trees or hunted bunnies, and then collect those few coins. It was boring, the sound design pales in comparison to other games where you slowly build up things, like Valheim or Minecraft, and the art style shines in a few spots, but the majority of things you'll be looking at are bland.

Reading the guides for this game, it's obviously not for me. There are certain optimal paths to take like Elden Ring or other Souls games, but if you fail you don't just restart with nothing gained, you've lost the starting currency and trees you're expected to be able to have to start on the island. And honestly, what am I building up to? My first island was boring when I accidentally left it, why do that again but harder?",False,1675269395

"I feel like I'm missing something amidst these glowing reviews. Here was my experience with the game: there's no tutorial, no text, no interaction with anyone at all. Fine, I can dig a silent kingdom management game. Characters cut down trees and harvest grains, but you have no investment in their progress because the ONLY resource you have to manage is gold. You pick up gold. You walk around. You find a spot that the gods have preordained to be a house or a mill or a tower or whatever (you don't get to decide!) and you chuck gold at it so your peasants will build it. The building generates gold and you pick it up and carry it around chucking it at new things to build. 

How much gold do you have at any given time? You don't know; there's just a picture of an empty/full purse to give you a vague idea of your resources. If you get too much gold, it spills over into the water and is lost, so spend spend spend! No point in saving up for an expensive resource! At night, little purple ninjas try to steal your crown which will ""kill"" you but there doesn't really seem to be any penalty for that. Your silent workers keep on plugging, gold keeps pouring in, and your fingers get sore pressing the side-scroll button and wishing your horse wasn't a purebred snail.

"A good game in general, but a number of flaws still exist.


1. Lack of proper tutorials
Not only this game has an unintuitive design but also has a poor tutorial. The tutorial tells you only the fundamental tips and all the small details are left unknown unless you look up the fanmade wiki. This confuses new players and may ruin the fun. It did ruin my experience, unfortunately. I thoroughly looked into the wiki, and yet, here I am feeling frustrated.

Here are some questions I had before:
Is the stag slower than the standard horse outside of forests? 
Why does the griffin have the rat-eating animation? 
Is the season cycle global or local?
Is the difficulty of nightly waves global or local?
How do I kill or at least avoid the boar?
What are the conditions of rabbits and berry bushes spawning?
...Where are unit explanations?

You can probably answer all of those questions on the fanmade wiki. And then you will realise how much this game fails to communicate with players. Without wiki, this game is absolutely unplayable. I cannot imagine the suffering of wiki creators.


1-1. Where in the world is the control guide?
THERE IS NO IN-GAME CONTROL GUIDE. This is one of the rudimentary parts of every video game and the developers magnificently manage to fail it. Props to them. The improper tutorial only tells you how to manoeuvre and utilise coins.
You will never know how to unseat hermits, use mount special, and controls for the 2nd player. Maybe the tutorial has taught me this and I failed to remember it. But still, the developers must rectify the unfinished, brief, and one-off tutorial per game. Look, just add the keys diagram. Simple.
I cannot believe that I have to look up the FANMADE WIKI for the control scheme...


2. Teleporters require clear distinctions
There are two types of teleporters as far as I know; one type allows players to select an arrival point, and the other type has fixed travel points that can be manually designated.
Their appearances are the same so we have no way to find out which is which unless you try using it. I would appreciate differing colours or anything.


2-1 Redundant teleporter cancel animation
With teleporters, you can spy regions or choose where to teleport. If the timer runs out while using it, the screen slides back to where the teleporter is. This is a quite significant problem on large islands. Since the screen does not immediately snap back to the original location of the teleporter, you are forced to watch the returning animation and waste several seconds. To put it simply, it is annoying. >:(


3. No sense of location
On large islands, it is difficult to tell at what point of the map are you standing. Though hanging lamps on archer towers and signs on border walls signify whether you are on the left or the right side of the kingdom, they still do not tell you where exactly you are. A minimap would be appreciated...

Over time, the Kingdom franchise has grown a fair bit in depth, and I feel comfortable recommending it.

I've purchased a few copies (with DLC) for friends on various platforms, after the numerous improvements that have been added.

While I'd still love to see more iteration on the gameplay mechanics, I think Kingdom is a great series that will hopefully continue to grow - and not just from reskinning the original campaigns and adding a gimmick or two.

I really do think that more technology expansion, or some other content accessible continually throughout all the campaigns would be nice.

Sure, war never changes, but we all know this game has benefited from changes.

So perhaps some non-combat gameplay would be rewarding, for after an island is liberated from the greed?

Kingdom is a side scrolling resource management tower defense hybrid with beautiful pixel art. I played the original briefly a long time ago and it has been fun to revisit this new version. The gameplay loop of living and dying and starting again to build from the ashes has me hooked right away. I had a great time figuring out the mechanics and moving on to new islands. I couldn’t put down the controller. Once that initial newness ran out and made it to the 4th of 5 islands the formula had because very repetitive.  I may come back sometime to see it through to the end but for now I’m burned out. Worth the sale price despite that!,True,1673975033

"Kingdom: Two Crowns is a really niche game in my opinion. I think it's absolutely brilliant, from graphics to sound to gameplay, but I do think that the learning curve is going to throw new players off (especially since they've balanced the early game around semi-experienced players). Still an absolute blast though, a shame I'm only just now really getting a chance to get into the third installment.",True,1673846016

"In Kingdom: Two crowns we travel across the land to different kingdoms to unravel the mysteries of the forbidden scrolls that hold the key to making the ultimate royal weapon. It’s easy to say that Kingdom is an indie game where you collect coins to become rich, but there’s so much more to this game.

The visuals in Kingdom look really polished. The animations and the voice acting is so much fun that it makes me want to play more! This game is all about collecting coins by doing tasks and progressing through the levels. You collect coins in order to progress through different kingdoms, each of which has different maps. Once you reach the end of the map, you unlock the next kingdom. You can only progress through each kingdom once you’ve cleared all the puzzles. The story in Kingdom is in fact not really relevant to the game at all, but it’s a nice distraction while you’re collecting all the coins. Enemies will sometimes appear in the levels that must be defeated in order to progress. You get coins for defeating enemies, but the coins you get for completing a level will be a mix of your progress and the enemies you defeated.

Verdict - Coin master.

"Awesome sequel to an already great game (Kingdom: New Lands). My main issue with the previous game was that it didn't explain anything, but in Two Crowns it has been greatly improved, whenever you discover something new, it's either self-explanatory, or the ""predecessor ghost"" will guide you. After playing New Lands, Two Crowns on the normal difficulty feels a bit too easy, especially since when you lose, the heir inherits the Kingdom, so you don't start from the very beginning. There is also much more content: different ""biomes"" and several challenge islands. The graphics are also improved, it feels more detailed and ""pixel-perfect"". I can see myself playing the game many more hours, replaying on different difficulty and playing in co-op, it's a long-lasting game that should be highly recommended to both those familiar with the franchise and newcomers.",True,1673788342
I really enjoy the game but it desperately NEEDS online multiplayer not just co-op with friends. Challenge islands are where it's at because the full game gets repetitious.,True,1673769290

"Very chill 2 player local-coop experience.

This felt like such an elegant and unique game that we instantly fell in love with it. Mechanics are simple, highly thematic, and most of the fun came from discovering how everything works since there are no tutorials -something that adds to the immersion. It definitely made us rethink how we look at pixel-graphic games.

It's fun and addict! I recommend this game to everyone and I hope that more people know about this piece of art that is called a 'game'.

"This is a neat little game but feels very unfinished. There is no ability to track anything at all (how many of x you have or how many people are in your town etc), nothing has any prompts so could leave your island randomly, there is no undo so you could potentially just ruin your game by accident. It's really tedious in how you have to slowly trod about the map. The menus even feel unfinished with their with some weird setup where up is scrolling through an option and down is enter. I understand that exploring your options and experimenting are core parts of certain games but building  games tend to evoke more more of a sense of personal attachment and immersion for the junk you made. Unlike a rougelike where you just go whatever and try again, it's really frustrating to mess up because of a really dumb UI or ""gamey"" reason.

This game is best suited for players who want to ""experience"" everything the game has to offer and then leave it alone. After building all the upgrades and seeing all the ""things"" the game is ""done"" and you can leave it and never return.

If you're expecting ""a game"", then give this game a pass, because there really isn't much of one here.

It's a shame, because with just a little bit of planning, the whole thing could easily have been much better. The simplistic design scheme is a lot of fun and the overall concept is great, it just needed some fleshing out in the strategic elements.",True,1673089631

"This is a good game, and I enjoyed my time playing it, but I soon found out that Gems lost on death are permanently lost if they are in your pouch.

I was doing a cave for the first time and - since the game has no ""real"" tutorial - I had no idea what I was doing. I lit the bomb, stood for a second, then noticed everyone running away. When I started to run as well, the steed ran out of stamina and I died in the cave.

That instantly made me stop playing the game. It's odd that gems lost in any other way - whether you drop them or they are stolen - can be recovered, but the ""death"" of your monarch loses them.

EDIT: I went back and confirmed. Ran all around the island, there was a gem chest left that had three gems, but the gems I lost were gone.

You can get them back if they are stolen when you destroy the cave ""supposedly"" - there are mixed responses that I've found.

"I'll start off by saying the whole Kingdom franchise is brilliant.
The first thing that stood out for me, was how easy it was to pick up: 3 ~ 4 button mechanics. This makes it simple and available for different kinds of players. Recently it's been added difficulty levels, making it easier for those who want it to be quite a challenge, or those who play it for a more casual relaxing experience.

Then the graphics... if anything can be called pixel ART, it's Kingdom. The diversity, the details, the animations, the environments / biomes, just gorgeous. I have more than 200 hundred hours on this game, and sometimes the sky, the colours, the reflections, all click together and I just stop to enjoy how wonderful the scene looks.
The music and SFX are equally good - it just fits so well, so natural, so perfect with the environment / biomes.

It's so well balanced in so many factors, and it's been worked on for quite a while. It has so much content and features, and keeps getting better and better as the devs continue adding to an already great title.

Kingdom was a great idea, that was perfected to... perfection. A true work of love and dedication, and it shows, clearly.
Unless there's something about the genre that just doesn't click for you (because one can never please everyone), this is one of the strongest 100% recomendations I could give.

"Relaxing base & tower defense game, with a unique basic yet pretty art-style, the game is minimalistic and sometimes requires you to go on the wiki to figure what to do & how to play, because the game doesn't explain much besides the movement and building purchasing, so only 3 buttons :\ ..
There is also coop which is great for a game like this!
It is slow, there is not much going on the screen and in game, so if you are looking for a game that won't stress you out, this might be good for you.

Cons: no way to speed up the game time - which sometimes can be annoying especially when you're just standing idle waiting for the night to pass by, no way to rebind keys, only x3\4\5\6 zoom levels and can only be changed from within the options menu - there is no button to change it mid game. game doesn't explain much leaving you to figure things out by yourself somehow..

The changes to Altars was really helpful and the addition of Two-Player Co-Op was amazing. I had a lot of fun playing the game with my friend from start to finish. We even managed to finish the whole game in one reign, an achievement uite rare. (It helped that I already watched other people play the game because I couldn't get enough of it xD)

Apart from the gameplay, I love the visuals and the music of this game. It's quite wonderful indeed. I can only recommend listening to the soundtrack and some extended pieces on Youtube!

So if you decide to get it yourself, have fun!",True,1671621770
"You absolutely need to change your approach to the difficulty level in the Kingdom series, because what worked in Kingdom: New Lands no longer works in Kingdom: Two Crowns. In New Lands, the goal is to leave all the islands to complete the game, so you need to optimize the way you earn money and your upgrades. The fact that the difficulty increases based on the number of in-game days makes sense here and works well because it’s about speed and optimization.

However, in its sequel, Two Crowns, the goal is no longer to flee the islands but to destroy the monster portals to free the islands from their hold. This requires optimization not to leave the islands quickly but to counterattack the enemies. I spent hours and hours making the best possible upgrades for my kingdoms, spent several winters in the game destroying portals so I could save time when returning to destroy the main portal. Yet, every time I reached island 4, I was completely overwhelmed by enemy hordes and could do absolutely nothing. I genuinely wasted dozens of hours of my life trying anyway, only to eventually look it up on YouTube and discover that the solution—OF COURSE!—was ""JUST GO FASTER."" So, to win the game, you just have to play like a complete fool without thinking about the configuration of your islands? I see no interest in that, especially since, once you have all the upgrades, the game becomes ridiculously easy.

So please, for your next game, create a difficulty system that changes depending on the island. That would be so much better!",False,1671596302

A lot of the game design choices were made in favor of aesthetic over quality of life. The game is very easy in many ways but you're often punished with a small coin bag, a manual bank deposit system, no dialogue boxes, and a lack of clear instructions to start the game. 

As I kept playing I wondered if I was getting it, what else there was to get and why it was so popular. It's simply a very niche game and I wouldn't recommend it as a solo experience. A majority of my energy was spent running left and right depositing coins and collecting coins and while it was satisfying it was too grindy. I felt often punished isntead of rewarded. Too many farmers? your coins will fall into the water. Upgraded the wall at the wrong time , now it's not a real wall and the enemy is invading.",False,1671064461

"This feels like a glorified, mobile idle game. There is virtually no gameplay in it and there are virtually no controls. But even then, they managed to screw up the controls. To gallop, you have to double press the move button. Something that seemed to only work half of the times I tried it. Meaning I unfairly lost much of my gold to the enemy. For a game with so little to do, it is frustrating that what there is to do has not been set up properly. (And I know that you are supposed to be slower in the woods, so that is not it – or actually, I am not sure about that as I can sometimes go through at full speed). And when completing a level, you have to wait for the boat to sail very slowly towards the end of it. No way to skip that animation. Enjoy your three+ minutes of idling. (Or I at least was not able to skip it typing any key I could think of) 

I can see why someone would enjoy this, just as I can see why someone would enjoy a mobile (idle) game. The music, simplicity, graphics and feeling of progression can be charming, even quite appealing. 
Just not for me. To me it barely feels like a game and I therefore can’t recommend it. Especially because the controls are broken. I know that I didn’t play it for long, but I did a lot of reading and seems like I managed to do everything there is to do in the game (which is very little).

good game.,True,1670967052
"I *do* recommend Kingdom: New Lands.  Don't play this - go and buy that.  This is the same game with some improvements but with the pacing, balance, and replayability all ruined.  Specific changes they've made:
 + Behavior of your minions is slightly less counter-intuitive and suicidal (but still pretty annoying)
 + Some minor UI tweaks to make things clearer
 - A *really* jarring graphical glitch when it auto-saves.  For a game that relies heavily on a charming chill atmosphere (and with such simple graphics), this is unforgiveable.  K:NL didn't have this problem.
 - There are some new things to buy/build.  Most of them don't change the game at all - just add busy-work.  One or two have interesting potential, but you only get to unlock and actually have a use for them after many hours of play (around the time you're likely to either lose patience or get randomly insta-killed)
 - After the first half hour or so you'll have SO MUCH MONEY it becomes an annoyance rather than a resource.  Your minions gather it up and throw it at you, but you can only carry a limited amount so effectively they are throwing your money away whenver you slow down close to them.  This makes 80% of your play time into a crap mini-game of ferrying around coins to somewhere they won't get wasted, and avoiding your own subjects (which means you can't stand where you need to stand, just behind your walls, to see what's going on during attacks).  Perhaps the way to enjoy the game is to just not care about lost coins, but you do actually have to store up a lot to survive winter, and there's really no way to avoid the coin-ferrying busy-work.
 - Procedural generation is gone.  Every game will be pretty much identical (they didn't even bother changing it for the DLC skins.  Why!?  It's what made Kingdom: New Lands replayable)
 - Difficulty progression is ridiculous.  No challenging attacks for hours of play, then suddenly insta-death.  (This was already a flaw in K:NL but now it's ridiculous)
 - You're forced to backtrack a lot of unlock needed upgrades.  This idea does have potential, but they way they've implemented just makes for a lot of zero-challenge busy-work.

"As of the time of writing this review I have 24.4 hours on this game and all the DLCs bought. I don't consider myself an expert but it's worth a shot to put my two cents in.

This is one of the games that I always come back to when I want to relax. It’s the visual styling that adds to the charm of the gameplay. It adds to the atmosphere of ruling your own kingdom along with another person if you choose to bring a buddy along in this gameplay experience. Personally, that's what made it special from all the other 3 installments of this franchise, the ability to bring one of your family members or friends along to play it and experience it while you both try to figure out what to do.

This game is perfect for anyone who is looking for a casual fun adventure and one that feels rewarding in managing your kingdom, playing with someone else alongside you, regardless of how advanced they are at gaming in general because the game is very easy to master in a short period of time, even with some of your older family members that aren't experienced with games before playing it. The objective of this game is pretty clear even without a strong story plot guiding you through, the only help you get is at the start of the game, just explaining the mechanics and different controls then you are on your own!

I strongly recommend this game if you seek a classic and casual experience of gaming, maybe give it a try sometimes!",True,1669750702

"This game is more than meets the eye. Hidden behind a quirky 2d horde/tower defense with a small management element is a great couch game for those dark evenings when you just want to build, explore and conquer in a fantastical world populated by greedy humans and their greedier dark counterparts.. 

The basic gameplay is rewarding in a primitive kind of way and although this is basically a slightly more advanced mobile game there is alot to explore and experience. The base building is the core gameplay interrupted by attacks from the mysterious Greed at nightfall, all in all it is a satisfying dance that gets even more enjoyable when you team up with someone to face the hordes.

In the end 2 Crowns is a nice couch experience, it might be a perfect example of a gateway game to bring someone into the otherwise slightly baffling experience that is modern gaming. It gets my grudging approval if not for its central theme around hoarding wealth and subsequently losing it.. So get on your horse (or similar riding companion) and just explore the surroundings until the Greed (a typical metaphor for global capitalism) threatens your feudal proletariat (well you pay them, once..). And should you be more of a Scandinavian metalhead, Deadlands might be a better start, and if Anime is more your thing there is a Shogun version..

"This is pretty much a singleplayer game with multiplayer carelessly modded in. My main problem is that there's no difficulty modification for multiplayer. It's just like playing the singleplayer game with another monarch copy-pasted in, whilst you're still fighting the same amount of enemies at the same rate even though you can cover double the amount of ground and such. A friend and I just breezed through all the islands on cursed difficulty without seeing a single breeder or flyer. What's the point of playing if even the highest difficulty is no challenge whatsoever?

Another note, this game compared to new lands seems very imbalanced. If you get the lizard mount you win the game and the norse lands DLC is so extremely imbalanced it's laughable.

"i really wanted to like this. the presentation, art and animation, music, and sound design are all excellent. it plays pretty compulsively, i like the ambiguity of the mechanics, and the sense of discovery and growth are very fun as you suss out little details of how the game communicates with you. problem is that the gameplay loop is busted in a couple ways and ultimately gets grindy. 

i think most informative is the way the fail state will be obvious long before it actually occurs; a few misplaced coins early game can slow your production down to essentially nothing while having spent everything your island chests provided, leaving you to either kill yourself or wait it out until you die, so you can get an arbitrary boost of currency to continue on. the game's difficulty curve is very unforgiving at first, but by the second or third island you have such an abundance of coins that you are limited by the game's artificial barriers - the upgrade you need is on the next island, but first you have to build your boat and go there and get the coins to establish that kingdom so you can get the upgrade and then get the coins to build your boat again so you can go back to the previous island, maybe first clearing the dock portal so you don't have to build your boat AGAIN next time you come here, etc etc. repeat this four or five times but without really iterating the mechanics (you're gonna go left... right... hold down... continually) or the game loop (a couple abilities, a couple mounts, a couple enemy types, a couple worker types - mostly leveling up by way of damage/health/quantity, not by complexity or style) and it feels like, does this really need to be taking this long? losing gems is particularly frustrating since they don't respawn, meaning you can lose your ability to progress (ie unlock the next material upgrade) without actually causing an endgame, which just seems like poor design. on top of this, ally AI is pretty unreliable. i think there may be some kind of attention radius? cause i'll have just a slew of builders milling about and a lot of unfinished construction projects further out, which leaves you unprotected.

probably works very well as a pick-up-and-play-a-bit mobile thing but feels kinda unrewarding and very flat in the long run",False,1668237792

To me, while it is an additional feature, adding managing previous islands either backtracking to ""complete"" them or making sure they are maintained in case you die just adds a lot of busy work and reduces replay-ability.  The previous games I could replay indefinitely.  This one I made sure everything was completely maxed out on all 5 islands once and I feel ready to put it down forever.

"The dealbreaker is long distances between points of interest (vagrant camps, chests, portals etc.). For some reason devs decided to do real-time light strategy game instead of turn (time) based. Maybe it is not for me and for someone who likes more relaxed gameplay... Other than that, all reviews written before this one covered the game pretty well, but I can parrot it too: progression and upgrades are decent, but not gameplay-changing, graphics are nice, music is ok.

If you are not deterred by negative reviews, I recommend buying the game on sale.

Edit: bugs too - fauna do not respawn, archers do not take their position in some towers, questionable object (tile) configurations.

Edit2: gave the game another chance - cleared 4 islands (1, 2, 3, 5). Running around still got annoying no matter how hard I tried to ignore it, or do planning, in order to save time. I still had to run around expanding a kingdom, rebuilding walls, replenishing weapons and tools, and giving orders. I like the idea, but hate the execution of it.",False,1666897236

"[h1] Kingdom Two Crowns > Kingdom: New Lands [/h1]
Before anything else, here's a list of things to consider when planning to buy/play this game:
[list]
[*] Once a decision is made (e.g., cutting down a tree, sending your army/troops to attack a portal), you can't take it back unless you try to cheat it and force close the game.
[*] It gets incredibly tedious from cutting down trees, expanding your kingdom, and going to the other islands. If you get tired of repetitive stuff easily, just skip this one because there's a high chance you won't even enjoy the game.
[*] The game never really tells you anything except for which to upgrade but it won't won't explain any descriptions or what're they for. It's either you look for a guide or just upgrade to see it for yourself.
[*] The AI of builders isn't smart. If you marked to cut down a tree far from your outer walls, they would often stay there until night and end up in the wave of greedlings.
[*] Once you destroy all the portals in all the five islands in a campaign, there really isn't much you can do anymore aside from starting a new game and do it all over again.
[/list]
Would I recommend Kingdom Two Crowns? 100% yes. Despite all that I've listed above, I still had way too much fun playing this game, even more than I anticipated.

And to add, visuals alone, it's way better than Classic and New Lands.",True,1666678933
"Same problems as previous game. It's a very simple game but it doesn't explain anything, so it wastes your time and calls it learning. You can read a guide and spoil the game for yourself or you can waste hours and hours and fucking hours learning the hard way. That's a bad game. 

Visual/audio design is great, very relaxing
Gameplay is boring, repetitive. and frustrating

Typical ""roguelike"" experience of stretching a small amount of content over many playthroughs via permadeath, except the only randomization is the layout of the FLAT 2 DIMENSIONAL environment. This randomization doesn't do anything except hide the fact that everything is copy-pasted, and furthermore, it can make things difficult and annoying. Calling this a ""roguelike"" is FALSE ADVERTISING. It's a simple tower defense game with permadeath to make it seem like a full game.

It's a tower defense game that's been dumbed down to 2d, and the only reason it's hard is because you have to WALK to your towers to upgrade them. Unless you're playing the dead lands DLC, your character can't even fucking do anything. It's so simple yet made artificially hard and frustrating. BAD FUCKING GAME.

The atmosphere is great, and the basic concept is very simple. This SHOULD be the perfect game for turning off your brain at the end of the night, and it is... once you've wasted like 20+ hrs learning how to actually play, through painful, boring, repetitive, and slow trial and error.

So much time spent silently running from one end of the map to the other... Oh and of course you have an essentially INVISIBLE stamina meter, so you MUST PAY ATTENTION AS YOU RUN SILENTLY FOR A MINUTE STRAIGHT. SO MUCH TIME JUST RUNNING BACK AND FORTH

Example #17: Once you place the bomb at the end, you have to run away immediately or you lose... even though your horse puts up the indicator that it's going to run out of stamina, you're just supposed to know BY PAINFUL EXPERIENCE, that it doesn't matter, just keep running... INSANITY. I just beat the game but lost because I didn't run away fast enough. How is this even real? ONCE AGAIN, HOURS OF MY FUCKING TIME ARE GONE. SO MANY COLLECTIVE HOURS LOST BECAUSE THE GAME DOESN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING.

I do have to mention that I encountered a few bugs and inconsistencies. Nothing game-breaking, but some of them are a little annoying.

If steam achievements aren't important to you, then this obviously won't be an issue for you.

"Really fun base defense game. A very simple concept of going from island to island defeating monsters known as the Greed, defending your crown from being stolen. Each new island getting a bit harder compared to the last. While the game is very simple, it is fun discovering all the items that can be used to defend kingdom and yourself. I played Kingdom: New Lands and Kingdom: Two Crowns on Xbox before buying this on steam, so my play time is a bit higher. I have enjoyed all the hours I've put into both version on both platforms. One of the biggest things that drew me into this game was how relaxing it is. The art style with the music  pair incredible giving off a nice, cozy, adventurous feeling. Although the game is great, compared to its predecessor, Kingdom: New Lands this one is easier to progress. After about 5 hours in game if planned correctly. You basically can't lose, since you start generating an unending amount of money. Unlike the previous version were you had to plan for winter, a season that made money gathering from natural resources impossible. This one has no such thing so you can spend money without worry. Making the game go from extremely challenging to only challenging. Possible the largest change from the previous version is the addition of co-op. Co-op doesn't really change much but lets you bring a friend to help you defend your kingdom. Finally there are also a couple of bugs still in the game. Like the spirit guide constantly pointing you to upgrade structures that are unnecessary. Or simply giving wrong information. However, the developers still put out updates from time to time that fix bugs. Overall, great game to play solo or with a friend.",True,1666305366

"Well, here we go again! Having played the very first Kingdom's I was enthralled with the game play and game aesthetic that so defined the series.  Grudgingly, I do recommend this latest installment not without some reservations.  So the GOOD first! You get FREE DLC! Yes! two more campaigns each one with different content. 
Dead lands, a KINGDOMS game using a different IP. Specifically from Bloodstained ritual of the night. As well as a SAMURAI themed campaign as well. Overall you get three Campaigns as well as challenge campaigns and you can also enjoy a co- op mode! For the price of five bucks It was a great deal! On top of that there is a NEW
VIKING campaign separate from two crowns. Will I buy it? Probably not. 
But allow me to continue. The best part of this game is you can CONTINUE when you die. Yes CONTINUE! No more allegorical life lessons in futility! You can ALMOST leave off where you lost in the game. Progress is SAVED!  It's not perfect though. The campaign consist of Four islands which you must clear in order to win. If you die on island three you must start back at island one. But the good thing is all progress you made on the rest of the islands as saved I.E. gates that were destroyed stay destroyed. In some ways making the restart easier then the previous play through. Time matters in this game, the longer you are on an island the more enemies spawn. Making time an important friend or foe. There are some new mounts specific to the new DLC and new monarchs. This all adds to one diverse little package that for five bucks or less is a steal! 
So what's the bad then? 
Well, having played all the incarnations of this game until now, with the exception of the VIKINGS campaign I have to say this series is starting to become somewhat of a cash cow for Stumpy squid and Fury studios. There's simply not enough diversity in the game play for me. Even with the added DLC of Deadlands and Shogun most of it simply felt like palette swaps. There's wasn't enough to justify the DLC other than it was free! But the problem with that is my time isn't free and wasting it on clones with minor game play tweaks 
is it's own lesson in futility! I know, I know I do recommend this game but the developers can do better in my 
opinion. How? Well for starters How about a 16 bit rendition!? 
The minimalist approach is really getting old. Time to upgrade I think! As well as a deeper more strategic game play would really push the series into a new era. I'm sure the NORSELANDS campaign already has some of what speak of but as a player in need more. 
Am I being overly critical? Maybe, but its adapt or die. I hope this series doesn't fade into obscurity.

"[i]This will be quite long and will of course contain spoilers, so you've been warned.[/i]

Played this game to near-completion (missing only one achievement that's not tied to ""Norse Lands"" and all ""Dire Island"" crowns cause I suck at that map). Most of the game feels like a good upgrade compared to the two previous games. The AI is still quite bad in some places, especially the dog AI, archers in ""Dead Lands"" not running behind walls on time, builders running from the other side of the kingdom while a bunch of them are standing near the damn wall I ordered to upgrade etc. Beside the AI, I'd say the game's pretty well-rounded.

The campaigns were fun. I wasn't too fond of the gem system at first but it grew on me. I liked the continuity after a defeat (my first death was me standing near the lit bomb and wondering wth is going on. I know, brilliant) and the idea of going through multiple islands to unlock things.

The seasons were also a thing that I really liked. Winter might've been hard sometimes but it made you plan ahead, which was nice. I loved the fact I could enter the caves and rid of the greed for good, gave me a huge sense of completion. I'm still not sure whether I like the new boat mechanic. I quite liked having to move it through half the map to the dock to set sail, but this new way isn't too bad either. I liked having to upgrade knights, tho the wall expansion sometimes made me want to commit war crimes. With that said, I loved the new fire mechanic and the warhorn. I always liked to clear one side first so I could utilize it. I also liked the new protective towers, cause F you, floaters.

A special thanks for the draft horse and stable hermit. The horse was great for winter, tons of stamina, and stable guy is a bro. Loved to switch mounts on demand.

Now, the things that bothered me. The the damn tutorial ghosts, for example. There should be an option in the settings to skip them altogether, even if it'd be on by default. I don't want you to float around and bother me after I accidentally picked up a hermit, and sometimes they told me to do impossible things like upgrading the mill while my hermit was stolen. I really wanted to slap them into the next week.

The other few things that really bothered me were probably the mounts. The bear in this version felt useless, same for the lizard. The mount abilities felt like it was something very needed since in the previous games I really felt useless as a monarch, only being able to drop coins, so this was a very welcome change. But that being said, some of the nerfs felt like too much. Pikemen also felt pretty useless, especially once I got fire barrels.

[i]Played the free DLCs and all challenge islands as well, so they'll get a short separate review.[/i]

[b]Shogun:[/b] Mostly cosmetic but damn if ninjas weren't OP. They changed how I played this campaign quite a lot, especially in winter. The theme was really pleasing to the eye, the music as well. The abundance of trees also changed how I played it. Overall, I enjoyed a replay using this theme.

[b]Dead Lands:[/b] I loved the creepiness of it, the music, the finally-not-useless monarchs and everything in between. To me there was enough new things to not feel like I'm doing the exact same thing all over again but I understand that to most people it won't be like that.

[i]Challenge Islands. Played all blind except ""Skull Island"" since I beat it in ""New Lands"".[/i]

[b]Skull Island:[/b] A fun challenge and closest to the original ""Classic"" game imo. The only thing I disliked in it was the griffin color in ""Shogun"" setting, but that's just me nitpicking.

[b]Plague Island:[/b] This one was a bit hard to get started, mainly cause I managed to get pretty bad camp rng a few times and the warhorse was near-useless. Managed to beat it and overall enjoyed the challenge.

[b]Dire Island:[/b] I hate this challenge, period. The dog AI is driving me up the wall and I don't think I'll ever get more than a copper crown. The idea in itself is fun but I can't tell you how many times this damn dog ran towards the greed past a wall or suddenly stopped in front of an active portal just to bark and get yoinked.

[b]Trade Routes:[/b] I really liked this challenge, especially since I'm a sucker for Dead Lands' aesthetic. This map was what I imagined the ""Two Crowns"" part to mean. Might replay it just for the fun of it despite already having the cursed crown.

That's all I can think about from the top of my head. There's probably a bunch of other stuff I forgot but this got lengthy anyway.

"I'll get this out of the way upfront. The main reason I'm not recommending this game is that this is not a $20 game, it's a PC port of a $7 mobile game that is identical. The original Kingdom game is also free to play now (here on Steam) and is largely identical in terms of gameplay and kind of functions as a demo of what's here. There's also quite a few bugs still present in this game that are present in the original (now free) game like sometimes builders won't remove trees you've listed to be cut down and the option to order an attack sometimes disappears.

With that out of the way, the game itself is actually pretty interesting with the pixel art and strategy and exploring and roguelite elements.

However this game does waste a lot of your time. Traversing the island takes up too much time with not enough ways to speed things up, mostly due to the low traversal speeds relative to the size of the island with no shortcuts. Some of the portals you have to destroy have obscene amounts of health and you can't build siege weapons to directly attack them so your archers shoot arrows at stone portals and it takes forever to destroy them as you would expect.

There's also the annoying gem mechanic where gems can be stolen by the bad guys if you get unlucky (and didn't bank them because the game never told you how that mechnic worked) but then the only way to get them back is to advance MUCH farther into the game (which may be far more difficult if as a new player you didn't activate the archer and knight statues like you were supposed to) to go inside the portals and retrieve the finite gems. I hate games that punish new players like this with snowballing difficulty for not doing the correct things upfront.

I also found it annoying how little your monarch can actually do other than throw money at things. Like I unlocked this awesome Griffon mount (that can't attack for Reasons) and can craft swords and armor, but my monarch is still completely helpless. Probably an intentional design choice, but the lack of direct agency you have is extremely frustrating at times.

Speaking of direct agency, you also can't undo assigning people to roles or deconstruct buildings (like watchtowers that steal your archers). This means if you're inexperienced with the game (as the developers intended by specifically mentioning trial and error gameplay) you can easily end up in a situation where you need more farmers/builders but can't tell your archers to return their bow (unless they get attacked and drop it).

At least compared to the original this updated version has adjustable difficulty levels, I found the normal difficulty to be overly difficult and frustrating, but easy was more reasonable.

Overall not a bad time waster, but still a somewhat flawed game that doesn't particularly respect your time that's overpriced for PC.",False,1665777689

"Almost 17 hours in and this is a borderline recommend for me.I felt like this game is a semi-tower defense and base building that is overall pretty fun, but there are a number of annoyances for me that make things more frustrating and drawn out than I feel they should be - mainly gold collecting, stupid citizens, and travelling within a map.

I despise having to go and manually collect gold from all over the map - I feel like there should be a ""job"" that you can hire someone for to do it for you at the very least and maybe also an ""upkeep"" job that will add coins during winter to the ""gardens"" or add coins when a ""commander"" is killed. Having to run around to pick gold up and putting a relatively small limit on how much you can hold before it spills out of your bag and some permanently lost is annoying. I would also much prefer a system in place where overall gold is tracked and spent from one central location without me having to go collect and deposit it constantly.

The second major issue for me are your citizens - if I was just attacked and lost a large number of workers of a type, I can't reassign existing workers to a new job, and they run after the closest available tool/weapon even if I don't need anymore of that type. If you're going to have your AI be somewhat brainless, then give me micro-management type control when I need it or allow me to pay and re-assign them.

The last annoyance for me or the mounts - they can sprint, but it seems like only for short distances before they run out of stamina and you're forced to walk. Sure there are portals, but having to spend 2 gold each time you use it with the money limitations outlined above can make it a pain.

So overall yes I recommend the game, but not at full price when I think there are better strategy games out there. I feel like the annoyances add unnecessary time spent doing chores rather than actually getting objectives done.",True,1665439452

- You can never have too many archers!

- Before you get squires/ronin etc, get plenty of archers first, as these recruited archers stop hunting (less money)

- Protect your gems! These are limited and once they're gone, they're gone.

- Try out the different mounts, and see which you prefer. They each have a different speed, stamina, and special ability(s).

- From above, I recommend the Stag and/or Griffin for newcomers, both are very useful!

- Have no more than 4-5 builders, until much later in the game where builders are ""used"" for certain structures.

- There is no limit to how many coins you can store in the bank, and you gain interest! Bank your money when you can (Banker only accepts deposits of 10+ coins)

- Activate the ""statues"" as soon as you can, ESPECIALLY the Archer looking one. You'll thank me later :P

Most of all though:
- Failure isn't the end, only a lesson.

So I love these games. That's why I purchased them on steam after so many hours on console. It's a unique twist on the whole colony sim thing and I honestly wish more devs took inspiration from it to create their own style of the idea. It's immersive, intuitive, beautiful, and straight up addicting. I couldn't not recommend this game... BUT.... Once you've played one you've basically played them all. If you were to play a Kingdom game for the first time you might as well play the newest one because very little is added beyond a re-skin. When I start up a new game It's usually Deadlands and the only reason it's ever not is for a change of asthetic. So what I'm saying is while Kingdom games are great, you really don't need to go buying all of them. I'd recommend just getting Two Crowns as it has coop and 2 free add ons which are essentually re-skins with some little additions.

I would actually recommend this game if it wasnt for the grudge I have against the developers regarding the graphics of the DLC's. I have played all versions of the game and love the playstyle but I genuinely dont like playing any of the DLC contents simply due to how much they have watered down the details vs the main games. For example look at the amount of detail in the dirt in base game vs say the Nordic DLC. One of the things that I first fell in love with regarding this game was how gorgeous the music and art was. It makes me really sad that the same effort hasnt been put into the DLC's. I would much prefer a new installation in the series than so many half baked DLC's...,False,1664452420

It's quite fun solo and coop, in my opinion. the game offers enough difficulty to struggle in coop (..when your coop mate decides to spend all the money on upgrading every single stump instead of investing into archers, farmers, craftsmen, etc...)

"I've changed my review from negative to positive. I still think the new player experience is unnecessarily confusing and frustrating, since the game doesn't explain many of the key mechanics.

For example, it's natural for a new player to assume that when you pay gold to change a vagrant camp into a citizen house, this is an upgrade of some kind, as it is whenever you spend gold anywhere else. But it's a huge downgrade, in fact, costing 5x more for the same units. You have to try to leave a tree on either side of a vagrant camp so it never disappears, and to expand past it involves journeying beyond it to the next open area and working backwards. 

It's one example among many (farms were another pain point). You pretty much need to have the wiki open from hour 1 to figure out how any of this stuff works.

However, now that I've put in those hours of trial and error, and browsing the wiki and reddit threads, I actually understand how it works and the game is really fun. Just needs some in-game help for the new player in my opinion.",True,1664342811

 Unknowing of perils ahead

It feels incredibly satisfying to see your pathetic camp with nothing but vagrants and a few coins grow into a sprawling medieval metropolis through hard work and stout defense. 

I recommend not looking up any guides/info unless you're really struggling, because it makes the completion of each island feel a lot more meaningful. One critical tip though: NEVER upgrade your outermost walls until you're done with each greed wave. Your archers, pikes and catapults will totally bail on you and leave the outermost line undefended until the wall is 100% complete, making your workers vulnerable to the greedy little bastards outside and threatening the safety of your whole castle.",True,1664171794

"KTC is a unique hybrid RTS/base-building game imposed on what is a functionally a 1-dimensional (left/right only) side-scroller. You ride your mount either left or right, collecting coins and then using those coins to build up a base and army. There is a day/night cycle, with attacks coming from both directions every night. There is also a seasonal cycle resulting to various changes in game-play, the most prominent of which is brought about by winter, during which money (and thus progress) crawls to a trickle. Having not finished the game, I can't state for sure what the ultimate purpose is, but you are tasked with building up a force of workers and an army, securing and expanding your position outward, and then building a boat to travel to another island. You will repeat this pattern on the new island, and again through five islands in total (though I got bored by Island 3). Each new island offers some unlockable in the form of new mounts, new builders, and new permanent perks, all of which are fixed to the given island number for each playthrough (i.e. Island 2 always has the same major unlockables).

Pros:
[list]
[*] The core game-play is soothing and enjoyable for a time.
[*] The feeling of progression is OK.
[/list]

YMMV:
[list]
[*] I realize that it is part of the core gameplay, but I find worker placement games in which i dont have direct control (or at least overriding control) over the workers frustrating.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] The game does a very poor job of telling you what you are actually supposed to be doing in the short term, the mid-range, and overall.
[*] Going from left-to-right and from right-to-left gets tedious quickly. The more you expand the longer you spend riding your mount back and forth. Some of the strategy is in minimizing this waste, but still, it gets old fast. And your mount bucking when you have ridden it too hard for too long is irritating.
[*] Though the core game-play is somewhat relaxed, make no mistake you are being timed. The enemies will get progressively stronger. In and of itself, there is nothing wrong with that. However, combined with the lack of direction, and the shelf-life on the entertainment value, this is not a game I am looking to start over and over in an attempt to optimize the series of tasks I accomplish. It just isn't enough fun for that.
[/list]

Summary: In the end, I just don't think this game is for me. I would have liked to have completed it, but I died a few times and a few other times I started over after realizing that I was playing sub-optimally. In the end, I just didn't like it nearly enough to start from scratch to sprint through the islands and then loop back to mop things up, all while spending most of my time just pointlessly riding back-and-forth, all for some unknown objective. I did enjoy most of my time with it, so it wasn't a complete waste of time or money.

"Hello, come, sit and read this tale of a game which is three... or more
This game shows the importance of a dedicated fan base in response to a team with a vision and the talent to pursue it.  The game is the ""culmination"" of a process which started with the ""Classic"" version, in which you had to survive as much as you could, but you would sooner or later lose.  It was a simple, repetitive, ""crap"" game BUT it had much potential.

The sencod game ""New Lands"" fixed several problems, you were no longer confined to a single map, there was a feel of progression AND, with a lot of thought and skill, you COULD win.  This was a fine game, a complete game, a thing of beauty... but it was nothing when compared to what was to come..

""Two crowns"" fixed every mistake (yes, even the suicidal knights lounge attack) and buildt up over the other two so much that it technically IS the same game, but it is not.  
1-You are given much more versatility, a heritage system with which you both get a sense of continuity AND dont simply lose, you are just set back a bit which allows you to quickly come to your earlier power. 
2- you have reasons to plan further ahead your travels (unlockables to come back to get, for instance), you can come and go from one island to the other and there are mechanics to ace it or f*ck it up
3- a days counter for every  single island AND a global one, so you know the more you stall, the harder it will get
4- more varied enemies and ways to fight them
5- more ways to manage your armies
6- more mounts with awesome skills AND a quick easy way to change between them
7- a proper season cycle!!!!! which forces you to plan ahead to better survive the winter and avoid stagnation
8- A WAY TO TAKE THE FIGHT TO THE GREED..... and stop their advance for good

And much more (im not even talking about how they skillfuly  touched up every building, or about the new buildings or how they improved the field of view, not even gonna talk about the DLC here), the game is GREAT, I could write pages on everything there is to like BUT i feel the best thing is what i've been telling you, it is one of those rare instances in which developers listen to feedback, think about it and actually knock it out the park, making a full game which will give you hours upon hours of entertainment.

"they've had years to expand and polish this game's formula since they just re-release the same game with new content yet they still haven't added two of the most important options in any building game: destroying buildings and canceling a building before it's finished.

if you misplace 1 wall at the wrong time you're fucked. it can actually destroy your entire playthrough. with the roguelike elements it can be particularly brutal if you make a building error. for example, this just happened to me, accidently placing a wooden wall 10 seconds before a raid. you can't cancel it and all your soldiers move to the next wall in the chain, so basically you've just fucked your entire army since that wooden wall is going to be destroyed in about 3 seconds.

this ruined my entire run. I lost my crown and didn't feel like playing again. annoying as fuck. another thing that's particularly irritating is the winter mechanic. seasons in games aren't usually a bad thing but the way they designed winter in this game is frustrating and boring. during winter there are almost no animal spawns, your farmers can't farm, and your main income source is replaced with berry bushes that only appear during winter. 90% of the gameplay is farming/hunting/building and you can't do any of these things because your income is razed to the ground.

the worst part is that winter lasts 16 days in-game which is literal hours in real time so if you haven't been lucky enough to store sufficient gold then you're screwed. even if you do store enough it's not fulfilling because winter is just THAT boring to play through. you'd be better off going afk and watching a movie.

that being said, the game isn't bad. I like it a lot and will probably still play it. deadlands in particular is better than the classic versions, and that's because they changed up the formula for once with abilities instead of re-using the same game like they've been doing for years. I'll be honest I don't know how anyone can buy the entire trilogy since it's just 1 game repackaged with small DLCs. even the difficulty options don't add much.

another weird thing is there's a decay system for your kingdoms where if you're away (playing the game normally and traversing islands like the game wants you to do) then your walls and lighthouse rot over time and break. I have no idea why that's a thing. it feels like a way to try and bloat your playtime.

overall, the game is fun until you place 1 wall and get fucked over by a blood moon because they didn't have enough common sense to add a cancel button.

might change my rating once I play more of the game but I doubt it. still gave it a decently high score since it's a really beautiful game. I love the art and the soundtrack absolutely kills. deadlands has the best aesthetics out of all the expansions. the gameplay loop isn't bad either.

Pros:
- Works very well on steam deck
- Amazing graphics
- Relaxing yet difficult at times

Cons: 
Very one-track. Once you've beaten a level, its pretty much the same thing over and over. The different kingdom types help and the DLC adds powers which can make it feel like a different experience, but the main game kinda caps out on entertainment value after the first run.

Overall:
Definitely recommend if you want a game to help you kill time, are in need of a relaxing co-op, or want a game that actually works on the steam deck (because those are so few and far between that this is the only one in my 150+ game library that works well on it)",True,1663385193

"Back when I first played the first Kingdom game, it was an astonishingly pleasant surprise. Not because I didn't think I'd enjoy the game, but because of the impact it made on how I experience a game and how its visuals and soundtrack can make all the difference especially when playing a title that, in concept, seems so simple.
Build, Expand, Defend: A simple premise expanded upon with finesse by introducing you to a land with limited resources to start as you're left to fend off the hostile land for yourself, immediately giving you full responsibility if your small village falls to Greed or if your kingdom will rise.
The gameplay leaves nothing to the imagination. All you can do can be done clearly, all that you can build should only take more resources and all that you can muster in a fight depends on your ability to lead your people to your cause.
Although the pixel 2D style of the game can seem limiting at first glance, Kingdom Two Crowns and all its other installments leave nothing to be desired when it comes to fleshing out its world with it's buildings, characters and landscapes. You can look at a rock and define its shape and size all the way to every nook and cranny. You can understand your mount's movement and how much effort it puts behind every trot. And you can tell from a glance what that villager is doing be it asking for alms, hunting or gearing up for battle. All of that because of how much detail and attention goes to every single pixel that moves on the screen at any and all times.
And nothing comes short when the amazing soundtrack is concerned. One could say that a game can a lot of the time be only as good as its music presents it. And I think no game could be the same without storytelling and ambiance that comes with a brilliantly crafted soundtrack, and such is the case with Kingdom. As good as everything else is, this game will lose a lot of its heart if it weren't for the warmth felt every morning, the lonesome cold every winter day, or the sheer dread accompanied by a blood moon night.
If there is anything I can say badly about this game is how it tainted my taste for building games, as now I am cursed by an endless search for another game like this one. 
If you're thinking of buying this game, as well as any other Kingdom titles, consider yourself cordially and summarily accosted to try it out. If you are anything like me, you won't be disappointed.",True,1661541021

those games that we finished, which were the early campaign games, seemed pretty easy. once you have some defenses up it seems that you can only win from there on, only the beginning is a bit uncertain. the challenge maps seemed harder though, but we couldnt finish a single one either due to early loss or this annoying bug.",False,1660841599

1st - its not a 90/91% Very positive game... its closer to a 5/10.  at 50% I'd be tempted to give it a recommend.  At 90% no it gets the no that it deserves.

Essentially it seems to boil down to its less of a game and more of a you have to follow a specific strategy to really make it anywhere... if you didn't enjoy restarting the whole game (rather than chapter/island) to try and get to the one specific way to actually 'play' the game.

Its 'explore' blah blah blah 'defend' but the defenders you get until quite late in the game are inept to say the least.

Going to add to this

Bugs - The game is chock full of bugs, several game killing ones... given it had forever before coming to steam where they were known and not fixed that is shameful to say the least

Bugs 
- Bannermen / knights running off to their death as soon as they are made... annoying, and they take every archer with them, run past portals and just die - game killing bug
- NPC workers stopping work for .reasons'
- Enemies able to spawn inside the defensive walls
- Beggar camps (workers) stopping production if trees near them are removed... oh good news you can buy a begger for 1 gold, they spawn daily.  OR you can cut the trees down, spend a bunch of gold on a building, then buy beggars for 5x the cost before... if its not a bug its absurd game design which is worse",False,1660517191

"I want to like this game, but I simply cannot. The game offers new players zero explanation. You are given a whole 15 seconds of tutorial to explain the controls, but sadly they explain literally nothing about the game itself. What really bothers me, is that in this game you can very EASILY get to a point where you are just stuck and waiting for death.  Its actually a simple game-play loop, pickup gold, hire units, expand, repeat. The issue is that if your kingdom build isn't completely perfect, AND you get some good RNG you've wasted your time playing, because its impossible. Even on “easy” your kingdom will stall out, and you'll spend hours just stuck in the mud. 
Fun game-play loop, but the lack of guidance, and the ridiculous economy mechanics make this game unplayable. Honestly, I got it %75 off, and it was too much.",False,1660494027

The music is freaking fantastic to listen to in the game, and so much so I have an entire YT playlist of both the Kingdom: Two Crowns, and Kingdom: Deadlands soundtracks.

"I bought the entire bundle on Steam sale for $15. For the first 6 hours I was completely hooked and couldn't stop. The art style is really cool, and the soundtrack is amazing.

That being said, the game is unbelievably tedious and grindy. You will spend multiple hours of your time running back and forth in the same 2D scenery and collecting gold coins. There is little exploration after you reach both ends of the island (can be done in the first 10 minutes). 

They call it a ""strategy"" game, but as far as I can tell, the goal is to build archers, towers, and walls and collect gold. Do that, and you'll win. It'll just take you like 20 hours.

There is little in game help to explain what everything does. That would be cool (a la Dark Souls) if dying wasn't extremely punishing. I have died twice in my game, once on island 3 and once on 4. If you die, you have to go back to the other islands to unlock the buffs, get the mounts, and hermits. 

Rebuffing requires you to rebuild your boat, which requires a bunch of gold and spamming your builders. After this is done, you have to sail to the island, go throughout it and reactivate each buff, then build ANOTHER boat, and sail again, ad nauseam for each island you have discovered. After dying a second time I couldn't force myself to do that again.

This game has phenomenal reviews and I imagine it's because most people who like games like this will give an indy game a thumbs up out of the hype or because they like the pixel art. It is a shallow, tedious game, and anyone who has played it for more than a little while would realize that. 

The coop MIGHT make it more palatable, though it'll still be grindy. If you get it on sale, it's cheap entertainment that'll keep you entertained for maybe 6 hours, so thumbs up. But from a game design standpoint, it's hot trash with good music and art, thumbs down.

Magic is one way as they already have Mythical beasts and it can fit a fantasy setting.

animal farms and a easier gold storage would be nice.

"Deceptively simple at first, but contains surprising amount of depth once you really get into it. I had the advantage of having a friend playing with me when I first started, and he had had some prior experience with the game, so the start was not as rough for me as it was for him. And when I say rough, I mean the game does not hold your hand - at all. You need to largely figure things out by yourself, and while this could be detrimental for most games, it isn't the case here. The reason why is because the more ""advanced"" mechanics of the game reveal themselves rather quickly once you figure out the basics. And I loved the fact that whenever you thought the game had shown everything there is to discover about it, it throws new stuff at you and forces you to adapt.

"Kingdom Two Crowns is an amazingly beautiful and addictive game. The soundtrack and art are wonderful. If there's a sale, I do recommend buying the pack with all the Kingdom games and playing through them in order, just so you can appreciate the innovations, but Two Crowns is the best by far. The gameplay loop is so fun, you'll lose hours trying to always improve stuff. I am SO thankful they added houses to replace destroyed vagrant camps. Many thanks for that!!

My one biggest complaint is that there are only three save file slots, despite there being 4 factions to play as. There definitely needs to be at least 4, if not 8, so you can have two of each faction. I'm guessing there must be some technical limitation, because it has been highly requested. 

Other than that, I wish that the Shogun faction had more updates, because other than ninja, it is essentially a reskin of the western faction. Dead Lands added a lot, and Norselands added a ton of new, cool stuff. It feels like a shame that Shogun was sort of left behind. It's my favorite aesthetic, but lacks the newer features. 

Amazing game though! I can't wait for the Night of Greed standalone and any future games!!",True,1657842647
"the foundation of the game is kinda fun. like a casual 4x. but there are multiple reasons i uninstalled/don't recommend.
- too easy to softlock yourself out of key items/abilities and the only way to get another chance is dying, which basically ends your character's career.  you don't lose all your progress, but a lot.
- at a certain point, the casual gameplay difficulty spikes and it becomes basically impossible to not die unless you're very experienced at the game, you bust your ass to set up defenses, and also you're very lucky.
- not really much replay value beyond failing/retrying.  every game either goes about the same way or you lose.",False,1657830997

All through commands you give through horse(or lizard, bear, moose, and more)back through spending the money in your purse.

These coins are also your health should you be attacked directly. Out of money? Out of luck, the next hit sends your crown flying and if you don't retrieve it you lose your reign. At least you have heirs to take your place...

Some nice things were added, hermits that allow you to completely change a building, new mounts, and gems that manage your rare items (aka all of the above).
Of course, the main point for me is multiplayer.

But there's still a big issue in the first game which sadly wasn't resolved...
the people are ABSOLUTELY STUPID.
They won't defend themselves when fleeing after a raid.
6 builders will rush out of the safety of the walls to claim jobs released by other  DEAD builders.
That may sound minor but the harder the levels get, the more precise your actions need to be... the more it matters.

"How is this hot gabage rated, so highly. 98% of players never finish the game. Less than 30% of players finish a single island. Yet this is flooded with tons of good reviews. By WHO? Not the people playing it, lol... (according to steam achievements)

I'm not impressed, at all, not even a little. I have played better flash games back in the day. The save feature seems to be designed by a dev who hates the players: auto saves right before you're about to die. You can't manually save like you would a check point: game overwrites any save slot you write to. Tutorial is useless, mounts have abilities, but you wouldn't know because the action key isn't even in the menu for control keys. Everything is left for you to figure out. Statue unlocks, building upgrades, units, etc... all of it is void of any information whatsoever. 

This is one of those games that's so poorly designed you need to play through a few disaster runs just to figure out what does what. There's not real strategy involved because the game doesn't offer you any information until you figure it out for yourself. Even after you unlock statues it doesn't tell you a single thing about it. It's just you put gems here, put gold here, now statue glows. That is literally it. And the day/night pace is horribly slow to the point you'll be sacrificing the horribly coded builders who go on suicide missions, while every other unit runs behind a wall when the enemy spawns. 

If you do decide to pick this up then don't worry about death, at all because it's designed to stop any new player winning on the first play through.

"This is a mixed review, where I played this with my partner while looking for local co-op games to play. Neither of us had played any of the previous games before.

[u][b]The Good:[/b][/u]
The game is beautiful, with art that changes with the seasons, and lots of atmospheric touches. It has a really great soundtrack, and I'm really impressed by how simple the controls and gameplay are. I had a really good time in my first couple of hours of play, despite not really knowing what was going on.

[u][b]The Frustrating:[/b][/u]
Which brings me to my first frustration: the game is very sparse on UI. This is great in terms of aiding in its simplicity, but the result is that a lot of things have to be learned through trial and error. It's not clear what various new buildings do. It's not clear that chopping down certain trees causes certain buildings to get disabled. It's not clear that in winter your income drops significantly, so that if you weren't prepared for it there's very little to do as you wait it out. Or that moving to another island keeps the season, so that if you got to winter and thought there wasn't anything to do, and thought you'd move onto the next island... you'd be starting from scratch with no income and basically insta-lose.

It just felt as if we were spending a significant portion of our time reading the (unofficial?) wiki to learn about what the game was [i]actually[/i] about. That there was a banker. Or that archers in squads in North Lands need to have shields before you can send them out in squads. Just lots of unexplained things. And it's not as if we want everything explained to us -- I like learning by doing, and I'm happy to experiment a bit, make mistakes, and restart the game if necessary. But there is a lot that I feel is almost impossible to know without searching online.

The last straw was that I'd have two squads moving out to attack a cliff portal. The archers would get there, fire a couple of shots, and immediately retreat (for no apparent reason?), leaving the squad leaders to just stand there tanking enemies until they died. After several times of this repeating this again and again, in the day, at night, trying various different variables to try figure out why the archers were retreating, and not finding a reason, I concluded that either the game was buggy, or unfair, or simply didn't respect my time, and I decided not to play any more.

I'm a bit sad, because there's so much there to like, and it feels [i]so close[/i] to being really good. Perhaps players who've played previous iterations of the game and understand all of the unspoken content enjoy it much more. I'd bought it on a deep discount though, and more than got my money's worth for the bits that went well.",True,1656852144

The good:
The pixel art is beautiful. The sound effects complement this atmospheric game nicely. The gameplay was engaging at first, until it wasn't.

What broke me:
Winter is incredibly boring. In the spring, farmers automatic money makers. In the winter, farmers need to be manually assigned to harvest berries. So every single winter day, needing to run to the far reaches of your kingdom just to tell farmers to harvest berries.
Btw, did you lose any of your citizens because the AI sucks? Were your builders or archers being idiots after dark? There's no way to know unless you count them manually. Part of the ""charm"" of a minimalist UI.
Builder AI prioritization is terrible. I had a citizen house that took over 30 mins to build despite having an overabundance of builders. 
Hermit AI is dumb as shit.
You just spent a tons of money on several knights and wonder why they keep dying? Nothing explains that the money they carry is ""health"" and they are basically useless without it. No, this isn't part of the game's ""charm"" because it requires the user to discover this critical detail.

tldr; It's a back-and-forth simulator in the worst way. Don't be deceived: The game might seem ""charming"" because it encourages the player to discover game mechanics; but in reality it has no substance.

• Indicar o destino do portal de alguma forma;
• Mostrar quantas gemas você tem armazenadas no NPC;
• HP dos inimigos/portais inimigos;
• Progresso de construções;
• Ordem de retorno para construtores fora das muralhas;
• Tropas de ataque atacarem inimigos mesmo fora dos postos de patrulha; (Para esse item tenho uma história engraçada: gerei uma espada para promover um escudeiro, ele então veio do outro extremo do mapa, foi promovido, e enquanto voltava fui atacado por inimigos voadores, e...os arqueiros passaram reto dele pra voltar logo pro posto de patrulha no extremo da muralha...)
• Priorização de construção;
• Barra de stamina da montaria;
• Contabilização dos NPCs existentes e priorização de cargos futuros;
• Construção rápida, ninguém merece ter que ficar segurando até todas as moedas serem processadas;

A queen or king  riding a mount with the reflection of a river under a big sky. The mounts are horse deer and griffin. There is a ship which makes travels to islands. Heroes should win the war by defeating the portals and be careful monsters can steal the items..,True,1656457146

"Kingdom Two Crowns is amazing even if you decide to play solo. It's a VERY simple game and you don't get tired much from doing the same things over and over again. Especially if you're the type who loves seeing PROGRESS... in the game... not real life though. If you're a fan of 2D Pixel Art games, this is a must have! The gameplay loop is great! Like I said, very simple yet fun!

Fun game. Can be rather relaxing while still having the capability to crush you the moment you really let down your guard.,True,1656278197
"When I started playing I thought the goal was to rush the boat and just see every island. Once I figured out there are actually goals, the game got more interesting. However, once you figure out how to use early game towers and farms, you become endlessly rich and can rush to the end of each level by massing an army relatively quickly. Except during winter. Winter is perhaps the most annoying part of the game, which would make sense as it would be for any conqueror in real life. But its onset and length can absolutely crush a run even when you did everything right. So the worst part of the game is that it doesn't really have much depth in terms of strategy.",True,1656269382

"I had a 75% discount on this. I feel this game is so poor and doesnt deserve the 30 min I spent on, I am taking the time to write a big ""PASS YOUR WAY"" before getting my refund.

As a Monarch you get coins and you spend them to build structures, recruit, train people, etc. it s how to give actions to the game. That sums up the tutorial.
No mechanics are explained, no buidings are described, you dont know what investing your coins is actually doing. After 30 min, and dying 2 times, I logged off to read the Wiki just to understand the basic mechanics... and after 30 more min I had skimmed through ALL the mechanics the game has to offer. And it s not much.
Recruit builders, build farms, get money/ economy and about 6 archers (early game). Then scale and build an army (aka a lot of archers are enough apparently). Survive winter. Kill monsters. Wins.

So the game is ""difficult"" because it lacks explanation and transparency. Any game developper can do that. Where is the content? Where is the interesting idea? Where is the fun mechanic or variation in gameplay?
To me, not much thought has been put in this game apart from the really cool visuals: no story, basic mechanics, challenging because there is no clarity...

Please devs, dont do more games like this. Bring something that inspires you, or just dont do games anymore. Games like that are like time-fillers, the equivalent of bad sitcoms that my aunt used to watch, getting fat on the couch. No soul in it. Just a ""consume-me"" game.",False,1656192042
"i have reviewed this game before but i always go back and redo my reviews if i end up putting more time into the game than i once thought i would.

Kingdom Two Crowns is a game that i have spent much time with, and although the hours aren't stacked nearly as high as some other games i have played, they are of innumerable quality.
this game is a lot of things, and it's experience is not for everyone

i want to first highlight it's immediate draw.
as a pixel art maniac, it's aesthetics pulled me in quite irresistibly. pair that with a medieval setting and the money is just falling out of my pocket to buy the game.
it's visuals have only become more and more unique and novel as the different DLC have released over the years. 
perhaps even more beautiful depending on your favourite culture and mythology.
i have always found it a surreal experience to have something so seemingly unrealistic, immerse me so much. it's as if you either become part of the pixelated world, or it's pixels just start to disappear after you start playing for a while.
either way, it's visuals are entrancing, nostalgic, and they hold a special place in my heart.

the second thing that took me, wasn't game play yet, but instead, the sound design and it's ever gorgeous music.
whoever worked on the SFX, props to you, as it once again immerses you without having to even try. 
every little pixel has a sound and it is actually cathartic. even when you at the highest point of action, you will find yourself pretty chilled out because of how light and muted everything is. there is nothing jarring to jolt you awake.
whether you are treading your mount slowly through the forest, one step at a time, in the soft, pattering rain, or in a desperate dash to reclaim your crown, as it's slowly tumbling away from you, with your coins flying everywhere, all because you misjudged a breeder's punch.
if you closed your eyes and tried to play.... well, you would probably lose.. but you would be able to acknowledge every sound precisely for what it is, all the way up until your demise... and probably fall asleep to it.
and when it comes to the music... Amos Roddy and ToyTree.... i can't even.
i listen to almost every song from this soundtrack and i listen to them daily.
when game music can apply to your day to day life, you know it's good. and yet it fits the Kingdom atmosphere just as it was intended too of course.
most songs are peaceful and poignant, some are whimsical and airy, opposed to what i said about the SFX, a couple may raise your heart rate, but all of them will take you to another place.
without a doubt, my favourite soundtrack from any game, and with pitch perfect sound design to finish.

the third thing i will talk about is....... the game play!!
i don't want to go into specifics as it really isn't that kind of game. and lots of the fun comes from learning your own way. i am going to get all mysterious and stuff now so good luck.
but to sum up:
it is simple to learn and hard to master.
it's intuitive. it doesn't hold your hand. it makes sense. it isn't obvious.
you will make mistakes. you will learn from them.
there will be kingdoms that fall to ruin and kingdoms that stand the test of time.
some will be small and stout, others will reach across an entire island.
all will be lead by you.
your coin pouch will go from middling, having just enough to pay for what you need, to overflowing into the bank as you wait ever impatiently for your treasurer to come out again, to cold and empty when you find your ill choices catching up to you.
you will find mounts of all things, each with unique qualities that you will come to like, dislike, and, as with all pets, you will end up favouring one above the rest.
as your kingdom grows and you explore the many islands overrun with greed, you will discover your subjects' undying loyalty, the diverse selection of professions they can have, and the unique qualities each of those will bring to your kingdom, all the while, the greed will be slowly introducing foes more foul than you would like to know.
trees are money, animal are money, people are money, buildings are money, time is money, and the greed will try to take it all.
on each island, you will find something old, something new, something you will borrow, and find there will always be something coming to get you as you race around and make the most of what you have to fight back.
it is really quite the experience, and, if you are fond of small moments being the most memorable parts of a game, not overstimulating and chaotic moments like a lot of other games, you will love Kingdom Two Crowns.

but before i finish, i want to mention the way they have crafted this game and continue to add to it.
the base game includes two free DLC that are, as all of the DLC are, entire re-skins of the original concept but with some new mechanics, mounts, enemies, music and sometimes even altered progression to shake things up.
i want to mention this because that means that the base game is entirely worth it if you want to play, but the last two DLC, Norselands and Olympus, being separated and having to be paid for, might not be worth it depending on the enjoyment you got from the base game.
i personally came to love all of it, and wasn't bothered by what could otherwise be seen as a somewhat lazy rehash in terms of game play, and that to me is if you are looking solely through a critic's eyes. 
i saw the amount of love put into every pixel, and how different each of the DLC were in terms of aesthetics and immersion, that i could look past a repeating game play idea.
and i want to mention, the two DLC that you pay for have a lot more going for them than the ones that come with the base game in terms of changing up the game play.
i think it's possible to be disillusioned by Shogun or Dead Lands, as they are only slightly different to the base game in terms of game play, and you may start to wonder why the last two would cost money. 
but trust me when i say they change things quite a lot more and if you enjoyed the free DLC, you will get a big kick out of them.
like i said, i never had a problem with any of it, but i know some people care about where they put their money, especially when it comes to DLC, so i wanted to hammer home the differences there.

and finally finally, one super duper important thing... it's Kingdom TWO Crowns, so DEFINITELY try and find a friend to play it with.
you can play online or play splitscreen, with the wasd and arrow keys respectively, if you live near each other and don't wanna both buy the game!!

i find it difficult to review games apart from their DLC because it all just tends to merge in the end, and for me, the entirety of Kingdom Two Crowns has been a great experience and i am excited to see what they do next. 

i hope this review helped someone and thanks to Stumpy Squid, Fury Studious and Coatsink for an amazing experience!!",True,1656184990

"Kingdom Two Crowns is a horizontal development on the Kingdom format— if you enjoyed the others, you'll enjoy this. I, however, found this to be more unbearable as the new features don't really ""evolve"" the way you play, but just give you more options in terms of mounts, hermits, and units. 

But none of that really matters because the best strategy relies almost purely on archers as both currency generation and defense, dwarfing everything else. It's buying archers, picking up gold, get stone and iron, and then rushing portals. This has worked in all of my runs. 

On top of that, we're still dealing with the hordes of greed that act the exact same way as before. If you wait too long or break a small portal on the later islands, you'll get a chance to see the two actually new enemies, which either book it to you to steal your crown, or breed a huge amount of enemies while being very tanky. Neither of these offer an interesting change in gameplay. Archers and a catapult were more than able to fend them off. 

The addition of the cave, the final portal of each island, is [i]extremely[/i] dull. On every single island, you bring a bomb to the cave, destroy breeding pods that summon only tiny greeds, and you just move forward. That's it. No interesting twists or skill involved even— it is easier to destroy the cave than to destroy the small portal leading up to it because it does not spawn any hulking breeders.

The only reason I found this game even partially enjoyable is because I played it co-op with a friend, which is how I'd advise you to play. The islands get larger and larger, so splitting even just travel time is extremely beneficial and just more fun (I am completely unsure how I have almost 23 hours in this game. Nothing in this game stands out in my memory).

The developers continue to add new campaigns to this game, which are largely retextures of most everything, with maybe a few nice gameplay gimmicks. There's no substantial gameplay difference in any (that I've played) that really makes it feel uniquely different from the main campaign.

The music and pixel art are great though.

The original Kingdom Classic is slow and repetitive, and while there are definitely improvements, Kingdom Two Crowns just bloats that original idea instead of introducing new vertical progression that could alleviate the tedious grind.",False,1656032075
RTS game that feels fair and challenging within the first island. Tough towards the 20-30 day mark which makes you have to leave the island to a new one. Excellent way to progress the game. Only wished it gave a tutorial on how the new buildings can help progress the game further without checking the wiki.,True,1656027927
1,True,1656024518
"Kingdom Two Crowns is the 3rd installment in the Kingdom series of games. The simple gameplay of picking up and spending coins and expanding your kingdom is still there, with slight variations from the previous games, such as new mounts and the new objective of blowing up the lairs of the monsters (versus just sailing away in New Lands). The main selling point of this version is the co-op mechanic, where a second player can join you (hence the title Two Crowns). However, the co-op in this game falls very short, and without it, it is nothing more than New Lands with slight alterations and small updates.

In terms of new content, there’s a new soundtrack, and some new visuals, but largely the same from the previous Kingdom games. There’s a new limited gem resource, which is used to unlock statue upgrades, hermits, and mounts; but it feels like a redundancy more than anything and a bad attempt at adding variety to the game. There are also the challenge islands, and as the name suggests, are extra challenges for the players to overcome. However, there’s not that much beyond one main mechanic that you have to work around, and will mostly be the same gameplay as the main game.  

One of the things that was done well are the 2 free DLCs. The Shogun one is mostly a reskin of the game, and Deadlands introduces new mechanics. These were a welcoming addition to the game, as they provided a newer graphical and soundtrack remix of the game, which helped make them feel like a fresh new game experience. 

The main aspect of co-op is having an additional player to help you out in your kingdom building, but there is really nothing more beyond that. You have certain events where you have to be together, like blowing up the monster lair and riding the boat, but that’s it. 

The other major problem with the game is that it’s not fleshed out. Despite the fact that it’s a co-op game, achievements that are earned through the efforts of both players are not awarded to both players, but instead only the host. Sometimes the second player will get achievements, but the requirements or triggers around that are a mystery. There are four campaign modes, but only three save files. The minion AI is still sometimes dumb as fuck. For example, archers will sometimes sit too far back for them to shoot (this made me lose in one of my games). My co-op buddy also encountered some visual/gameplay bugs with the knights and archers. I personally have not encountered many bugs, but based on what I see on the forums, there’s still quite a bit at this time since the game’s release.

Two Crowns isn’t a totally bad game; I would put it somewhere in middle. But I’m more critical of the game because by their 3rd game, I expected something better and greater, especially with the fact that the core gameplay of Kingdom is quite simple and has been kept throughout its 3 games so far, and its current price point. The lackluster co-op, minimally new content, and unrefined state of the game were big disappointments for me. For that, I do not recommend this game.",False,1656021043
"Kingdom Two Crowns is extremely buggy.  Important events required for progression sometimes don't occur (numerous people have posted reviews mentioning this, and it happened separately in single player to both me and my wife today), causing the run to be soft locked.  Co-op is laggy and teleporty and doesn't let you pick a character.  In single player, you can pick your character by repeatedly pressing down on the loading screen, but if you take too long to find a character that you like then it loads and you are locked in.  In co-op you just can't choose at all.

I bought the game on 75% off and it's really pretty, so I probably won't refund it, but honestly I doubt I'm going to get a lot of playtime out of it.  It took 97 minutes for me and my wife to manage to start a co-op game and then it was too laggy to play, so we're giving up.

Look elsewhere, even on sale.",False,1656019917
It's the only game I've played in over a year... I'm addicted,True,1656013055
"Disclaimer: At time of writing, my only experience with this game has been playing co-op on the Shogun version (on a cross-platform save file from Switch).

I've enjoyed this game way more than I thought I would. The mechanics seemed kind of simple to me on the first pass, but the more I've played the more fun I've had. It's incredibly satisfying to build your kingdom up from a little campfire, and it feels so good to survive the challenges this game throws at you. We're frequently cheering aloud at the triumph of taking down that last wall-buster or finally making it through a long winter. The graphics are simple, but they work effectively with the game's beautiful soundtrack to create an incredibly immersive atmosphere.

There are obviously still some bugs that need to be worked out in co-op/cross-platform saves, but so far none of them have been major enough to make us want to stop playing. Once we finish our Shogun campaign, I'm pretty sure we're going to continue finishing campaigns in all of the other game modes as well.",True,1656001956

"Before I start, this is my first Kingdoms game. I don't have prior experience to it's previous release. 

**CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS**

This game is fun. It's simple, it's soothing. The soundtrack is S+, and the pixel graphics have been scratching that itch I've been looking for in a game. 

Since I got it during the summer sale, I got all the DLC, but I started with Classic. I haven't put it down since I bought it. Be warned, mechanics wise, it pretty much is the same thing on repeat, island after island. Some might find this boring, but I find it really soothing to play, especially to wind down. I managed to get my first Monarch to Island 3 in classic, before delving into the others. The Shogun expansion is pretty much a reskin with a couple different twists on the classics' units, but overall plays the exact same. The other thing I find interesting is that even if the Monarch loses their crown, it's not a complete game over. While the islands do decay and you have to recruit the hermits all over again, it doesn't completely erase what you've already unlocked. I died on Island 3 during my first playthrough, and while it was frustrating (mostly because I went exploring without realizing the time of day), I was surprised to see that all the stuff I unlocked could be unlocked again with coins, rather than gems. 

Norselands, on the other hand, is what I've been really sinking my teeth into.

It's different enough mechanically, despite the absence of some units, and I find it really enjoyable to be able to defend with the shieldwall rather than a bunch of archers firing over it. It's really helpful in the first few islands, especially when you haven't unlocked the Archer statue. Another thing that I love is the Monarch powers you get from completing different puzzle statues of the Norse gods. The first time I unlocked and used Mjolnir was both hilarious and satisfying. 

As of right now, I'm focusing on finishing through my Norselands playthrough before starting on Dead Lands, which I saw offers a different set of playstyles. But I can't wait to see what I encounter next!",True,1655933227
"There are some things I appreciate about it like the minimalist UI and the light tutorial. The art and ambiance were both very pleasant, too.

The main thing that kills it for me is how dull and tedious the gameplay is. You run to this spot to buy an upgrade, you run to that spot to buy an upgrade, you recruit Joe Shmo for a role you need filled, you fend off creatures at night, and you start all over again while gradually taking down portals. It's not a particularly thrilling gameplay loop. The running gets old after a while even with the griffin mount.

One other complaint I have is the difficulty in figuring out certain mechanics without a guide. Most of it is pretty straightforward and can be learned through interaction and experimentation, but I never figured out how lighthouses, decay, and bankers functioned and don't see how I could've reasonably worked them out. I do appreciate games that make me think, but not when I'm thinking my head into a wall. Hell, there were mechanics that even the guide author couldn't figure out. I don't like it when games hold your hand like Skyrim does, but I also don't want something so complex that it takes me out of the game and breaks immersion.

Lastly, winter sucks ass. It offers no interesting or engaging challenge and all it does is make the game into a slogfest. It doesn't even make the game that much more difficult; it's mainly an annoyance that makes you wait a short while for money to start flowing again.

It feels like the game was going for mixture of immersion, engagement, and relaxation, and they all clash with each other in the worst way. I see it's trying to be relaxing with the atmosphere, but that gets bogged down by engaging you with subtle mechanics. When it tries to engage you with subtle mechanics, it breaks immersion. And when it tries to immerse you in a world with minimal UI elements and a sense of exploration, it loses that initial spark with repetitive mechanics and makes you run back and forth until you hate your life.

All and all, it's not a great game. I kinda enjoyed it for the first 15 hours, but then I spent the rest of the time wondering if I wanted to keep playing this game. And when I read a guide and found there was nothing else to look forward to, I just gave up.

I will say it was a good try, at least. Hopefully this developer will be able to make better games in the future.",False,1655931070

[b]UI:[/b] Extremely minimalistic. Most of what you need can be seen in the game instead. For instance, you never know how many coins you actually have. And you never know how much you hold in your castle, but you can see it gradually filling up when visiting your castle. The whole game is filled with small, yet impactful details like that.

[b]Onboarding:[/b] Easy to get into, hard to master. No forced tutorial to go through. No in-game wiki. You will need to search forums to find out what everything does, and that is okay. It takes you back to when you played a new game in your youth, where there was so much to discover, ponder, and learn.

[b]Coop:[/b] Amazing. I used to play a lot of MOBA's, RPG's, strategy games and so on. (""hardcore gamer"") And my girlfriend wanted to play a game together, thinking of mario, the sims, and old-school nintendo games. (""casual gamer"") It is hard to find a middle ground for so different gaming personalities, but this is it. She wasn't used to the industry standard WASD controls, and it works just fine with this game. Our main challenge now is to find a new similar one, after having finished all of the expansions.

[b]Replayability:[/b] Fairly high. There are several difficulties. The expansions retain the core game, while being different enough for them to be worthwhile. I'm not much of a self-punishing gamer who wants to struggle, so I played through them all on normal, preferring to have more of a relaxing experience.

[b]All in all:[/b] This game truly is a polished gem, and unlike any other game I have ever played. 

Minimalism is the holy grail of any art form in my opinion, and [u]this game is a piece of minimalistic art[/u]. All the small details. All the information you don't have, yet you don't need to have all the time. The lack of complicated controls. The simple, yet immensely satisfying challenge of the game loop. The progression. The hidden secrets. The AI. 

*[u]A note for hardcore gamers reading ""this is art"", thinking it's more of a visual novel or something potentially boring;[/u] It's not. It's a satisfying strategy game at its core, but without any fluff. There are no perks, exp, skills, levels, and so on, but you get most of that same progressional satisfaction from mounts, statues, and buildings. Give it a try, perhaps when you need to relax a bit, or when you need something to play when traveling.",True,1655833099

There's not much other way to go on with the game, eveything stays the same, and in the next playtrough you would know everything and what to do. It's just you doing it the same again, without much variant on how to do it. To me it turns into sort of a relaxing farming game(fine by me), pretty grindy to begin with too.

Sound effects? Really good?
Music? I bet you can guess.

You hire the plebes, you build your base, you fight the demons, and you move on. That's the whole game! It has clever powers for your monarch, fun mounts, and it doesn't need a lot of explaining. Very clean and quick and endlessly frustrating when you can't beat those darn blood moons! 

My favorite element is that as a rogue-like or w/e its called, instead of just starting over, its your successor who you play next and the ghost of your last monarch is now giving you instructions.

"My gosh, what to say other than this one is bathing in simplicity. Simple premise, simple graphics, simple game-play. I mean, the game consists of you picking up coins and prioritising where to drop them. That's it! Granted, Two Crowns has dropped more content into the mix compared to the other two titles, but it's just more of the same really. So why is it so dam addictive!? Easy answer, the simplicity. The biggest criticism of the game is also it's biggest strength. It's so satisfying to watch your little camp fire develop to a vast kingdom over time due to just dropping coins. Couple that with watching your minions defend it from the ever growing horde of monsters, it equals a fun experience overall.

It is simple yes, but it's a gaming experience that is hard to find elsewhere. I have yet to play co-op and I can only imagine that sharing this game with someone else would only enhance the enjoyment. Due to the simplicity, this is an easy one to drop and pick up, so I think the price is just right.",True,1654648357

""Show, don't tell"" works great in games to give you a feeling of no ""hand holding"" to make the player feel smart, but this is an exaggerated waste of time for the player, first 5 hours is just trial and error, no way to know what you're spending your coins on until you spend them, which will obviously lead to major mistakes which would lead to a restart further padding game time just to justify the 20 dollar price tag. invisible tutorials been around in Half-Life 1, this game can take some notes instead of just being blatantly fucking lazy.
Also by the time you figure it all out you'll see what a repetitive boring shit game this is in the late game, it should've been much shorter.

Buy it for a price of a phone game, maybe.

"Kingdom Two Crowns

Plot:
There really isn't any. You're given the frame work of a plot-line, but mainly it's up to you to make your own story. You're a King or Queen (Or both depending if you do Co-op play) who's attempting to build their own Monarchy once again to ultimately defeat the Greed, a money hungry based enemy who will steal all of your gold and make your life on the island(s) a living hell. That's basically it.

Gameplay:

Seeing as I have nearly 100 hours into this game, I'm certainly biased to some degree. Many people have completely put down the game due to there not being much information (if any at all) on many key features such as the Bomb for Cliff Portals, Hermits, Mounts, etc. There is a basic tutorial at the start of the game that shows you how to get basic defenses, mark trees so your builders can cut them down, hiring homeless vagrants for your own kingdom, etc. 
  The enemy faction fighting against you is called the Greed. They are greedy bastards and will steal any gold you have on the ground, or in your bag if they manage to hit you. If you have no gold, your crown gets plucked off your pixel head and that's basically game over. Well, not exactly game over but I'll let that for you to discover yourself. Without revealing too much about the Greed, just know that it only gets harder to deal with them as you progress in the game. Veteran players will know what I'm talking about.
  This game has a very big emphasis on the ""Show don't tell"" mentality, and I'd say that's a plus in this case. If you had everything being spoon fed to you, a lot of what makes this game great as you progress would be completely gone. The unexpected can be fun - though I completely understand the frustration when players get their first Blood Moon or new enemy type and proceed to die. Just part of the learning experience, there's not much you can do about it unless you want to watch some tips and tricks videos or some guides on YouTube, though I'd highly recommend not doing so as learning is a key element of this game.

Visuals/Graphical Demands:

This game uses pixel art, though its easily the best pixel art I've ever seen. Everything looks beautiful, and any screenshot taken at any time is easy wallpaper material. Snowy mountains, foggy meadows, blue skied sunny afternoons, etc. Don't let the look of the game turn you off to it, you'll most likely be completely shocked once you realize this game is much better looking when everything is in motion. 
  I played this game on my 2015ish Macbook Air laptop, and it ran this game at a smooth 60+ FPS all day. With a standard office PC, there's no doubt that it wouldn't run smoothly. I always recommend checking the technical requirements before deciding to get the game even if you're sure.

Audio/Music:

The music compliments the visuals perfectly. Songs such as  Mischievous Alchemy, A Simple Question, and Meadow are amazing. Each DLC has their own respected music and (depending on the DLC) completely different sound effects. From the morning bells, to the archers shooting their bows, everything just works. The sound effects match the visuals and the atmosphere flawlessly.


DLC/Additional Content:

As I am writing this (1/29/23), there are currently 3 DLC's for the game. Shogun, Dead lands, and the Norse lands. 2 of the 3 are free, and are already installed with the base game. The Norse Lands is the only DLC that you'd have to pay for, and it's only around $7. Shogun is based on the Japanese Samurai, Dead Lands would be witch-craft themed, and Norse Lands is based on vikings Norse Mythology. All are amazing, and as I've already mentioned, 2 of them are completely free. I recommend all of them.

Overall Summary:
An amazing game. A gem in the rough if you will. This game is worth the $20. If you can get it on sale, that's even better. I promise you it wont disappoint, and even if it does - refunds exist.

KTC is a good example of economy and flow in games. All you do is basically spending money but this game manages to entertain you with just that one mechanic. It's amazing how you always find yourself going back and forth between having so much power you don't know what to do with and being so poor you think you're gonna lose.
Eventhough I think it's intentional, the AI is a bit annoying and you constantly wish you had more control over your men. Probably designers wanted to keep the simplicity and not overwhelm the player which I can say they didn't but on the other hand many times while playing I found myself screaming at my workers because of the stupid things they did.

But this one has the most content and co-op but it looks like it's focused on the co-op, if you play alone you are going to go through a nightmare especially in Dead Lands and Norse Lands...
So I recomend playing it IF you get a co-op partner to play through the whole game with you, if you don't have anyone to play with I recomend not playing this one.

"**NO SPOILERS**

I don't quite know why I enjoy this game so much. I've done every DLC aside from Norse Lands as of now. It's a really laid-back strategy side-scroller. You start by returning to the land your previous ruler failed to maintain and destroy creatures called ""greed"". They come out at night to attack your kingdom and it's your job to destroy the portal(s) they emerge from. 

The very basic thing to understand is that there are 5 islands. You cannot complete the game, nor destroy portals on the first island. YOU MUST EXPLORE. Build the boat and explore the islands as you try to defend yourself the best you can. If you ring the bell next to the boat after it's built completely, it will call some of your servants to join you at the next island so you don't have to worry TOO MUCH about harder waves on a newly founded island and can rebuild quickly.

It can start out very slow and it is not even close to a kingdom simulator. You don't REALLY get to control troops, their routes, when they go back to the kingdom, or their speeds. Try your best to not get upset at the clunky AI mechanics and understand that it's a VERY quirky game with good graphics, and unique gameplay. 

You will need to plan a little bit ahead about some things. For example, can you put a coin on that tree in the distance, and will your people successfully cut it down and get back to the kingdom in time? Or will they just walk 1.5 tiles/s back to the kingdom while the greed advance at 6ish tiles/s? There are definitely things to consider with these minor flaws, but if you think ahead you will not find it a hindrance!

It's a fantastic game no matter how you look at it and I would recommend it to anyone who likes side-scrollers or medieval style games. There are better kingdom simulator games out there, this one just has that special feel that no others can achieve with it's simpleness.",True,1653709397

"Definite must buy. It's a massive improvement over the original in many fun and interesting ways. 
The multiple campaigns might not feel that different, but you'll still have a lot of fun playing them, as each is set in a visually distinct era.

Though I have some gripes, it's still a game I fully recommend.

Gripes: ~~
Ninjas. They're terrible. They work as fisherman & attackers. If you haven't taken much area, they work fine. If you have, the majority of them spend most of the day & night running back and forth between the frontlines & the village center.
As attackers, it's a cute idea to have them hide in the trees. It's also not a forward thinking idea, when you take into account, that the trees have a gameplay effect of noticeably slowing down every mount(except reindeer). So you're very vested in clearing that trash out of the way for the campaign. You'll also want to clear it, as archers(in all campaigns) are by far the best money earners until you have permanent farms. Ninjas don't care though, as they'll still run out, only w/out tree cover they'll mostly just die. Ninjas are cool, but their implementation make your prefer they just work as fisherman, sadly not an option though.

The banker: The banker is annoying. He'll constantly run at you, if you're near him, and start dropping coins without your input, that you may/may not be able to hold. As the moment you get the baker, you'll start spending the majority of your time in the center near the banker, this quickly becomes annoying. He also randomly starts dropping coins, even if you're in the process of giving him coins to put in the vault.

Despite allowing players to clear a side, half of your military, new recruits included, will still not give the faintest of fks, and will happily waste bodies and weapons guarding a side that will never see an attack.

Also, why is getting the smith to spawn so damn bugged?

Why is it laggy in the feudal japan campaign, when you're going through the forests?

Why can't I watch the ship wreck. To see why the ship wrecks. On every single island?
Can an option be added to allow the monarch to kill every single crewmember that allowed the ship to wreck on every single island? 

Why is repairing the ship so unbelievably annoying. 1-2. 1-2. 1-2. 1-2........................................................ 1-2. 1-2. 1-2..... 
Monotonous af. Slow af. Annoying.

Lastly, Kudos! They finally fixed the damn bug where mason will run all the way across the map at night time, when you're attempting to capture swaths of land between decent defense points. 
Though for some stupid reason I don't care to know, you still can't cancel orders. So there are still a bunch of ways, it fks you over, that the devs have some stupid coniptions about allowing the fking king/queen to say, ""Yeah don't do that thing I said before"".",True,1652971268
"The best part of the game was the music but the rest of the game was really lacking.  I had a very buggy experience where I had to close the game and restart in order to leave each island.  No clear UI, no workers to tasks UI, no way to manually assign workers to towers or tasks, builders constantly run into the horde of danger, progress is often unclear and poorly explained - if at all.

"This game is me and my girlfriends favorite game to play together. It is simple yet difficult at times. A lot of what the other reviewers were saying is very true. It's the same game over and over and over. However, it's so enjoyable to just be a king and order armies and armies of people to their doom while fighting off the greed so you can make money. The soundtrack to this game is PERFECT. It is creepy, it is calm, it is delightful, and at times even scary. Getting immersed into this game is one of the best things ever. Because of how simple it is, you can throw a movie on your second screen for those times where you are doing basic things. It's similar to grinding in any other game. I highly reccomend it.

**THE ONE AND ONLY REQUEST I COULD HAVE**
The ability to mod the game. And if that is impossible, I would LOVE for the devolopers to just add DLC for SKINS ALONE. You could do sooo many cool things with skins in this game. Imagine that your Monarch is actually a cult leader, and all your believers all worship Cthulu as intended! ugh.. One can only dream. Buy the game. Sale or not. Worth every penny.",True,1652937889

Takes a bit to learn what everything does in your first playthrough or if you go to the wiki and read up on what everything does if you want things easier.
The longer you play and further you progress stronger enemies will appear which makes how you build your defence more important. Even if you would loose your crown your heir will take over and enemies will be as weak as you started the game so you can recover. 
There are ways to deal with most things even if you would loose a part or parts.
There are different seasons and they effect your income a lot.
A lot of choices to do when expanding.
The only thing I could find a bit tedious is the travel back and forth at times.

It's a very intuitive game, so it has a small learning curve (which makes it very easy to jump in and out of, even with long periods between play) where time will fly by, with enough 'variety' via the DLC, island layouts and choice in 'weaponry' to make it easily re-playable. It's just a nice game to splurge out on and chill (especially if you are a lover of base building and management - again it is very intuitive and quite simple, so you'll never feel like you have a relearn the wheel).",True,1652912531

I'ved owned every iteration of Kingdom since the original and will continue to buy future versions / expansions. I also own the Android Two Crowns and probably have close to 500+ hours on it in addition to my PC version.",True,1652856164
"Kingdom Two Crowns is a pixel-art 2D side-scrolling action-strategy game where you accumulate and spend resources to try to beat a series of levels. It's kind of a strategy version of a Rogue-like, meaning that it's a strategy game rather than strictly a fighting game, as your character doesn't do (much) fighting directly. However, you're expected to replay a level many times as you discover the mechanics, the consequences of your actions, and unlock bonus features that you will need to win.

Kingdom Two Crowns is the sequel to Kingdom: New Lands, which I've also played through.

THE GOOD:
- You can play 2-player co-op, which is overall really fun
- There is some some genuine strategy in very simple mechanics. Basically, you choose where to go (it takes time to move from point A to point B and you can't be everywhere at once), and you choose where to spend your limited funds.
- Some genuine surprises are in store (when playing New Lands there was at least one moment where my jaw dropped and I nearly had a heart attack), although the surprises can be quite demoralizing at times.
- The game does not allow save scumming, which leads to a much more exciting and tense game.
- Two Crowns doesn't force you to start from scratch after every death. Playing through the campaign felt less repetitive than New Lands did.
- In New Lands, when I beat the final island and saw the credits roll, it felt good! It took me about 22 hours. I did not have the heart to try the bonus Skull Island DLC.
- The Challenge Islands in Kingdom Two Crowns are quite fun (Trade Lands, in particular) and gave me another 15 hours of fun. They change some key mechanics to give a different experience, and start you off in a really difficult situation, and require you to complete everything with one reign (like in Kingdom: New Lands).


THE BAD:
- I also played the original Kingdom: New Lands and there is not enough new in Two Crowns for the main campaign to be challenging. I lost only once because I didn't know how a new mechanic worked. It took me 14 hours to win.
- Playing with a friend, while very fun, makes the game dramatically easier. You no longer have the painful trade-off of figuring out which side to defend at night, as you have two monarchs that can defend both sides at the same time! And it doubles how fast you can build things and do stuff. Beating the campaign was a breeze in Two Crowns Co-op vs the original New Lands Solo, which was very difficult.
- The game makers explain basically NOTHING, with the in-game tutorial offering only the most elementary information on the UI interaction.
- Due to the low-resolution pixel graphics, it's not always obvious what a thing even is. Expect to spend money on things without having any idea of what they will do or what the implications are. And then expect to lose because your choices were bad.
- The completely obscure mechanics require you to waste fruitless hours in experimentation and replaying levels when a simple, brief explanation would save you from all that pointless grind.
- I ended up looking up some answers on the Internet, but this has the risk of exposure to major spoilers.
- Expect to feel frustrated during a very difficult learning curve. There can be a huge lag between making a strategic choice and discovering the consequence. The inevitable result is getting your ass handed to you (often only some hours later).
- The levels are randomly generated, so you sometimes get a really good one and sometimes a really bad one. If you've got a bad level, it's not always obvious until you've wasted a few hours. This seems less of an issue in Two Crowns than it was in New Lands.

THE UGLY:
- In New Lands the NPC AI is idiotic. It's fairly predictable in its stupidity, so it's largely possible to work around the stupidity of the NPCs. Two Crowns greatly improves the NPC AI. It can still be frustrating at times (such as when you have only 2 builders and they insist on both going left or right instead of splitting up).
- There is no ability to cancel a command. This is a deliberate design choice by the game makers. It means that a momentary lapse of reason can completely ruin hours of work. This issue is actually worse in Two Crowns. In New Lands, when you die you start over from scratch. This means if you made bad choices it gives you a new chance to do things right without losing all your campaign progress. In Two Crowns, the structures remain even after you die, so if you place buildings badly you're stuck with it unless you restart the campaign entirely!
- There was a bug with the merchant--after he'd been removed from the map, I saw him walk across the screen... but he was rotated upside down!
- When you lose your crown, the camera does this disorienting thing where it focuses on the crown instead of you, and this can be very confusing.
- We once saw one of the monsters drift past my troops and then wander all the way to the central castle before coming back.  It was really weird and wasted a lot of time!",True,1652841612

On top of that the game runs on unity and I know unity, doing button remapping takes like a couple of hours at worst, game's been out for ~30k hours now and the devs couldn't take a single one to fix an issue they would know about if they spent any time listening to their customers or simply not live in a cave...

"After playing Kingdom: Two Crowns for over 20 hours, I can say the longer I played, the more frustrating experience it was. There's so many flaws that it's hard to remember all of them. 

1. your archers shoot like idiots and miss VERY often. It's not a problem at first, but when you're on fourth island during winter, every single shot counts.
2. Once you recruit a squire, four archers join his troop and will stop hunting and you'll quickly end up in the following situation. You're desperate for each single coin. You have 8 archers with your squires, deer passes and not a single shot will be taken.
3. The waves of mobs are getting ridiculous. Flyers that kidnap your archers in a single sweep. Spawners that happen to appear in pairs show up on a second day on a new island (that's on normal difficulty).
4. Pikemen that wander aimlessly left and right.
5. Trees that sometimes (often!) can't be chopped down.
6. Workers that never get to a task.
7. The whole portal mechanic is broken. You have several on each island that keeps spawning infinite number of mobs. Destroying one doesn't give you much. The mob waves will keep coming from the next one. Until you hit the cave portal, which can't be destroyed until very late in the game.
8. Upgrading wall temporarily tears them down, making your defenders thoroughly confused. You're not supposed to upgrade during evening or night, I get that. But why isn't there a way to tell your morons that they're supposed to stay in place and wait till the upgrade is done, and not run away to the next wall?
9. Most of the time you're fighting with the game limitations (why the heck trees can be marked for cutting only sometimes?)
10. The concept of several islands that you need to visit multiple times is cool. But since it's such a core mechanic of the game, why is it so tiresome to set sail between them? Your ship crashes every time, unless you build a specific building that available only mid-game. When you call your men to board the ship, you never know if anyone will come. If they come, you never know which squires will you take leaving your walls defenceless.

1) The game is very, very often either boring / nothing much happening or you have no chance and just watch as wall after wall falls and you know that you will lose in the next 2-15 minutes no matter what (yes - again very boring).
2) Orientation is a big problem and the map / level sizes are a problem which makes the game boring / tedious:
Shortly after the first stage you'll often find yourself in a position where you have to ride from one end of the map to the other end of the map. Again and again (getting new people, harvesting / gathering gold from your subjects and vice versa.
Also when you beat a level, you often don't know, if you've finished the level or not and which level is the next one unless you really search for it or probably use the wiki (haven't done that yet).

So all in all the game is a good grab for 5€ and below but else I wouldn't recommend it as it is unfinished (only very few / no bugs though: the woman that helps you upgrade jumped off the horse for no reason and did so like 5 times within 1-2 minutes and the other thing is fast riding where you double-tab left or right which can be a bit tedious as it doesn't work too smoothly but you'll do it a lot so you'll get the hang of it.)",False,1652364735

"Aesthetically, the game is absolutely superb and gorgeous. In terms of gameplay, the core loop is really addicting and the developers have also improved dramatically on the previous games. Compared to Kingdom: New Lands, this game features lots of quality-of-life fixes, the frequently asked-for AI improvements, a lot of rough edges smoothed over (for example: all unlocked hermits follow you automatically onto the boat, so you can actually make use of their abilities even if their abilities are not all equally useful) a free DLC in a gorgeous feudal Japan setting, and even special challenge islands. I haven't tried coop mode yet but I love that it exists. A lot of love has been poured into this and it shows.
Another addition/change I really enjoy is lighthouses, and the ability to revisit islands without losing all your progress (or, with the lighthouse, even crashing your boat). Sailing around, coming back to existing islands to repair the town or expand its borders or upgrade it or vanquish the Greed when you couldn't before feels a lot more... kingdom-y than in previous games, and it's great.",True,1652227857

Building your kingdom and discovering new islands filled with new content and puzzles is even better when you are not the only one not understanding them but it's also easier as it's harder to lose when your partner can just make you another crown
DLCs are also great even and let you enjoy the game for longer (and two of them are free)

"Kingdom Two Crowns is a beautiful pixel art game with a simple control scheme. The mantra 'Build. Explore. Conquer!' sounds a lot more active then what is in reality a relaxing tower defence game. You play a series of monarch's attempting to secure your kingdom from the invading greed monsters, adorable little purple cthulus intent on stealing coin, clothes and gear from your subjects. 

You have to pick your theme at game start between Medieval, Nordic, Edo Shogun and Undead - this influences your building art style and mechanically each theme has a special unit. For example Medieval gets the Pikeman, an excellent defensive unit who will fish for you all year round - really helpful in Winter when you Farmers are pretty much idle.

There are lot's of little quirks I enjoy here. Whilst technically a two player game, I completed the entire thing solo (it just took twice as long). I like how everytime I failed my character became a ghost who guided the next monarch. I liked the randomisation in level spawn, every Island felt like a new adventure. I liked riding Bears, War Pigs and Undead Unicorns. Best of all is the gorgeous terrain and seasonal art, which frequently changes as time passes.

My only gripe with the game is that sailing between islands is a chore. Sitting idle for 5+ minutes on large maps waiting for your retinue to walk from the edge of the map to the docks is a poor design - why cant they just teleport to player?

Overall a hidden gem which I might have just dismissed as a simple side-scroller game.",True,1652086723

"The biggest positive for me personally is the art. It's gorgeous. That alone makes me not regret buying / playing this game. 
 
Unfortunately there's not a lot else going for it.  It's fun the first time round discovering all the secrets, but then the charm fades quickly and it turns into rinse and repeat. 

There are also so many weird annoying bugs that make the game harder or break completely, that happen to an unnerving degree.

I had a new horse, and it forced me to switch back to my old one when I ran past the zone I got the new one from, and now I can't remount that new horse again.... (there is no prompt to pay again or remount, there is no sequence or time of holding any button or key) I'm aware that you CAN switch back and forth freely, but this was not a choice I made. I ran through it and it auto swapped my mount. The horse is actually roaming around OUTSIDE of the zone it came from.

I have villagers stuck at my archer building in a group. They don't move, just a frozen blob of villagers. 

My ship wouldn't fill all the way multiple times, despite having the correct units to fill it. The AI trying to load the boat would get stuck running between the boat and the town.

On multiple occasions my farmers would NEVER go to the fully upgraded farms. seems to happen on the right side only so far. They just walk around in town as if they're not needed (like they do if you have extra units that have no where to go); and I just have 2 empty farms on the right. (all the time, no matter the day/night/correct season cycle)

On multiple occasions I would have fresh villagers pacing around in the town not picking up a single tool despite ALL of my tool buildings being full of available tools to pick up. 

Sometimes an axe wielder will die while cutting down a tree, and then that tree will just... be there. forever. unable to cut it down again. No matter how many other axe wielders you have.

Sometimes the farmers will just stand around right outside the gate of your village at night (not running to the inside like the rest of the AI) and then proceed to stand there and cower until death because they didn't move a few pixels behind the wall. 

Spoiler bug : [spoiler] the stable hermit // stable -- once you've ridden every horse from the stable you can't ever ride it again on that map. If it's a feature, it's awful. [/spoiler]

The achievements don't award accurately, I was having achievements pop up for things I did 4 hours in the past; and I'm missing multiple achievements. Example : [spoiler] The here kitty kitty achievement is to use gems and get the cat chariot, which I did; have screenshots of; don't have the achievement. [/spoiler]",False,1651950479

The pixel art is very nice to look at, and the soundtrack is fantastic. Overall, it's fun, charming and engrossing, and it's super easy to play for hours without even noticing.

One thing I realy like about this game is that you can approach it in radically different ways. Do you want a hardcore experience where you need to delve into the game mechanics and optimize your strategy to beat the game in a single reign? Sure, you can do that. Do you just want to sit back, take it easy, relax and enjoy the ride? That's absolutely possible too, as long as you don't mind losing your crown a couple times (which effectively restarts the difficulty while hardly undoing any of your progress).

We (for example) didn’t understand that we need to discover the stone cave to upgrade the buildings even more. We visited all 5 islands before understanding. Also, each character and each animal have special abilities that need to be known to fully exploit them. And these are just some examples.

The game is rather short, but fun. Nice chill game to play with a friend and better than the first part of this series. Also, there are 2 free DLCs that don’t really change the gameplay, but the art style. They allow you to have a more spooky or a asian art style.

"An interesting and decently executed concept that badly overstays its welcome. The simplicity and lack of direct control is initially attractive, and the mystery is fun to explore.

This is where the simplicity immediately begins to backfire. There aren't multiple ways to approach the problems you're facing, you know exactly what you need to do, and you know exactly how it's all going to unfold. You just have to watch your bumbling NPC subjects faff about and hope they can execute their obscurely organized priority list in a way that doesn't get them killed and set you back X number of days.

"The 2D sidescrolling element is unique. The upgrades are well balanced. I just wish there were more expensive things to spend your money on after you beat the greed. Something cool like constructing a bridge or some other monument. Because for me, after about the third island, I'm swimming in money and I just leave it on the ground.",True,1650648606
"No, I would not recommend you to buy this game at a full price. The concept is great - the gameplay, although very simple, is entertaining and will provide you with great enjoyment. At least the first few islands that is - before the game starts to get hard.

At least for me, once I progressed far enough and the ""big boi monsters"" started to appear, I found myself majorly frustrated with the way my soldiers and army behaved. Soldiers were ignoring monsters right next to them, just to get slaughtered without putting up any kind of fight - not bothered in the least to even attempt to hide behind the barricades I upgraded for them. Is there some mechanic I should have known in order to manage the soldiers more effectively? I don't know - the game never told me anything about it. It insisted on showing me how to upgrade my farm with a special NPC instead, for the 100th time.

Kingdom Two Crowns is not a bad game. It's not an overly buggy game. It's a huge pity the systems are so poorly explained to the player. I could have enjoyed the game much more if they weren't so cryptic.",False,1650643905

"This game is lovely, it follows a simple tower defense genre flat 2d-plane portals on either side. Very simple, but the sense of progression in this game is pure bliss. Your realm goes from shitty camp in the middle of woods to an archipelago of impregnable fortresses. From simple horse to the greatest mounts in the pantheons of Europe, Asia, and realms beyond. All of this combined with some of the most b-e-utiful pixel art in the last decade. And you have a game more than worth it’s 20 dollar price tag.

"Although it's quite simple, Kingdom two crowns (and all the DLC it comes with and offers) is a very well put together game well worth it's price point.

The art style and soundtrack are both so beautiful, the devs have done an excellent job. Two things I struggled with briefly while playing: #1 It's hard to know exactly what spending coins on buildings and people get you. The merchants and hermits have symbols above their houses, but I still frequented the Kingdom 2 Crowns wiki page to see exactly what each hermit did and what the tower upgrade did. The second thing is that I only wish there were more islands, and more diversity in the nature (such as more biomes, desert, more mobs). We breezed through it in probably 20 total hours of game play, and I was honestly kind of sad when we finished and I wanted more. Definitely easier with 2 people.",True,1650303556

This game is literally so beautiful, from the water to the animations to the weather makes me feel like I could play this game forever. So relaxing yet also consistently challenging which is super refreshing, you can take it at your own pace or rush through - you can vary how you play and what tactics you use. Also if you play co-op, although it is easier, it is super enjoyable consistently for both players. If anything it gets better the more islands you unlock.

That said, this game does very little to teach you about how everything works. Small tutorial in the beginning and that's it. You need to figure almost everything on your own. Some people don't like this approach in games, but I think it makes the game more interesting and challenging. Exploring things by yourself and finding the best strategy that can move you further.

The game play is very disappointing. There are no many real choices or strategies one can make. It is all can be summed as - collect money, build the next wall, chop tress, repeat. It gets boring after 1 level. 
The movement in this game is very slow and most of the time you will be walking from one edge of the kingdom to another. It is possible to gallop which makes it a little faster but the stamina of the horse is limited. Trying to gallop when the horse is tired makes it stop for a second breaking the momentum of movement.

"You arrive at a mostly empty island and are greeted by a ghost telling you to follow him.
While following you pass by a small stone structure that seems to be a writing of something break down and falling apart.
You arrive at this empty plains with 2 people standing there doing nothing. The ghost tells you to drop them a coin, and now they serve you.

You set up camp, you hire builders, build walls, build towers and start exploring.
You start cutting down trees so you can expand, and you eventually walk past a camp with 2 people in rags, you drop em a coin and they serve you. You start hiring bowmen to hunt some game and make some capital.

Then Night falls. You think nothing of it at first and stroll around the forest. You see these purple-ish creatures walking towards you.
You curiously head over to greet them, but instead you are greeted with an attack and an attempt to take your crown. It's knocked off and you quickly recover it and head for the walls. The bowmen make quick work of those creatures and you survive the night.
You now understand what this is about.

You keep building, expanding, and build an army. The nights were a struggle at first, with sometimes the walls not being strong enough to hold for the archers to kill them off, as more and more of them arrive. You take casualties. But the crown survives.
You rebuild the walls, and you recover the casualties you've had. You need to improve on this wooden wall, but you can't. You do not posess the means of making this better. You need to figure out where you can find the means.

You find a shipwreck, and start putting in resources to patch it up. Once finished the builders take it to the dock. 
You call upon 3 builders and 4 bowmen to accompany you, and you set off to another island.
When you arrive it seems you have wrecked your ship, and you'll have to start over again here with the people and money you brought with you.

You get on your feet pretty quick and survive the first attack without difficulty.
Expansion begins again, but what's this? In the middle of the forest you now find this stone arch. You approach it, and suddenly a purple glowing portal opens inside of it. It seems something is coming out. It's one of those creatures!
You make for the walls and the bowmen make quick work of it.

It seems that those creatures come out of those portals. You didn't see them on the first island but they must be there as well. By that logic you assume that there are more portals on this island than the previous.

On the other side of the kingdom you eventually come accross a big stone quarry. You realize that this might be what you need to improve on your wooden technology and you turn it into a stone mine. You have now entered the stone age.
With this you start developing your building rapidly, stone walls, castles, catapults, spearmen and squires. All at your disposal.

You hire a couple of squires and it seems they are gathering an army of bowmen to serve at their side. At the outer walls you notice they are waiting for orders. The portal is not far from here, and the night just ended, so you give the order to advance to the portal.

You march to the portal with the squire and 4 bowmen. When you arrive at the portal and start your attack it opens and those creatures start defending it, the squire deals with them while the bowmen continue their attack on the portal. After a long battle, lasting half the day you destroy the portal and march home. 

An uneasy feeling suddenly grasps you. As you watch your surroundings you see the sky darken. When you arrive at the other side of the kingdom you notice a massive army of those creatures approaching, with 3 bigger ones spawning in more of them. 

Despite your improved walls they don't hold long and the creatures start bursting through, taking whatever they can and defeating your men. You retreat all the way to the other side of the kingdom, as those creatures break through wall after wall. On the other side your men start attacking those creatures as well.

One of the big ones collapse and theres 2 more left. But it doesn't change anything.
You watch as your entire army is erradicated and you are completely defenseless. As the night now falls and creatures start coming from the other side you are trapped.
They attack you and you lose your crown.

The kingdom is lost. Actions have consequences.
All you can do now, is hope your successor will be better prepared than you were.",True,1648798407

"I’ve played Kingdom Two Crowns for roughly 23 hours and have completed the basic game. I found the game very enjoyable and enough challenge to keep my interest. I would recommend it – just note it’s not going to give you 100s of hours of enjoyment  like many other games.

For those who have not played Kingdom New Lands or Kingdom Two Crowns, at the core both games are tower defence games. The beauty of both games is the simplicity of them. Literally you can go left, right, or press down to do an action. That’s it. But the diversity of tasks that can be performed with those simple controls is impressive - from building walls, towers, ballistas, catapults, cutting down trees, etc. Both games have intentional simple graphics and music, which adds to the the charm.

If you’re considering this game, there are a few things to know:

This is a stand-alone game but it is basically an extended version of the original Kingdom New Lands. The graphics are the same. The music is the same. Much of the content is the same. The company had originally intended Two Crows to be an extension for New Lands, so this makes a lot of sense. I found the additional content added to the game, make sense and felt very natural - as opposed to extensions I've seen for games where the content doesn't make sense and feels forced onto the player. 

A couple things I liked about Two Crowns over New Lands:
- One of the biggest issues in New Lands was finding something new but having no clue how to use it. This was most problematic with the hermits in the game – sure, searching google it was easy to figure out, but without doing a search, it was not something you were going to accidently figure out. In Two Crowns they definitely fixed this issue by using a fairy – when you pick up a hermit, a fairy appears which basically is a floating tooltip. It points you to where you can use the hermit. I found it was an excellent addition to the game in the beginning, but annoying in the end as the fairy follows you around until you do the task or drop the hermit. There may have been a way to turn off the fairy – I never took the time in the settings to look.

- Winter comes…. but it also goes and spring returns! In New Lands winter came but never left, and was basically used as a timer for each island – in winter resources become more and more scarce while the hordes continue to increase in size. For the most part, if you don’t get on the boat in the first couple days of winter, you’re done – it may just take a few days for it to happen. In Two Crowns winter is very much a season, and spring returns in a reasonable time. It gives the game a more realistic feel, but also removes any real pressure to complete an island.

- The goal of the two games is different. Both have the boat you need to repair to sail to a new island. In New Lands, building the boat was the main goal. In Two Crowns the boat is just used to get to a different island, and the main goal is to destroy the Greed on each island. 

- One of the most noticeable new features in Two Crowns is you can enter the portal at the mountain and destroy the Greed inside their realm, thus securing the island. This feature provided the feeling that you’re fighting for your island, instead of just building a boat to flee from it. As a side not though, once you light the bomb in their realm, you have to run like there’s no tomorrow back to the island if you don’t want to die in the blast. Note – all you guys will die in the blast – I couldn’t figure out a way to save them, but it’s easy enough to make more.

- When you die in Two Crowns, all of your structures on all of your islands remain (minus the ones that decay over time). In New Lands, you start from scratch.

- Overall I did find Two Crowns less challenging that New Lands, but still quite enjoyable.

So, would I recommend it? Basically, if you enjoyed New Lands, I think you’ll enjoy this game as well. If you found New Lands tedious or boring, you’ll likely find the same with Two Crowns. 

Hopes this review has helped you decide if Two Crowns is a game for you.",True,1648696641

"Great game, but not for me. If you take too long you lose, it's a timed mission without a timer through and through. It's sold on the idea that you have to manage your kingdom 'well' but it's really mostly just knowing when to get farms and move islands. 

You'll get the most fun out of it by restarting, trying out the different kingdoms, and then uninstalling if you're like me. 

Perhaps the co-op is better, but I'd imagine is just the same thing but with two players. You can not attack enemies, you can't even undo things. One single mistake is usually obnoxious, with others setting you back so far you got no choice.

Additionally, if you take 'too long' the game will still be easy until a blood moon comes and you got no choice but to lose as a massive boss comes out with no prior indication of existing and, since it's a sidescroller, you can't get past them to buy bows back for your men to fight it.

For me it's a classic that defines something refreshing, easy to get into, harder to actually master but not that complicated once you understand how the mechanics really work. 
I bought the DLC and even if it was mediocre (which it isn't), they deserve it. They made two DLC sized addons to this game already (Shogun and Dead Lands, the later being my favorite), for FREE.

"Well, first of all, the game by itself is nice. So why I'm not giving it the thumb up?
To sum it up:
-> The gameplay is overly simplified, and the game consist ONLY on it's gameplay. There isn't any story (my review is done after finishing only the main campain as it felt too empty in the end to continue the other ones). Moreover, your success will depend most on predicting the IA behaviour than ""managing"" anything (it will imply a lot of alt/F4 & re-launch to load and prepare for an attack, or if not repeating again and again the same stuff between each defeat for quite a long time).

Details:
Good aspects:
-Nice concept & ideas
-Good design
-Good music (not awesome, nor medium. Simply good ones.)
-Good core mechanics

Downsides:
-You can't cancel a construction order
-You can't give custom orders to troops.
-when you improve a wall, it doesn't protect anything during construction.
(So if you try to upgrade these and that ennemies approach too soon, you won't be able to cancel the upgrade, your workers will stop to try to flee, the wall will be useless and the ennemies will just massacre the unprotected troops then anyone in at least half your kingdom or all of it... if you don't loose before that)
-Your king/queen can't kill a thing. Weaponless.
-There is a lot of mounts, but only the Griffin is useful (and in fact, the only one giving you a chance to survive the most powerful blood moons if you protect your walls with his skill).
-Only Auto-saves at the beginning of the days or when you quit the game. No fixed saves, so you can load at most one day before a massacre to prepare for it.
-punishing events that, with the IA being what it is, will just make you loose or alt-F4 before that to re-load & try to  prepare for it for the short previous day (For exemple, Blood moons or Winter)
-too limited gems (a currency to get bonus from sanctuary, hermits to get new buildings & finally mounts. Each campain have a fixed amount of Gems and you WILL loose some of it against the ennemies... pretty frustrating when finished to be unable to get some nice stuff because you never been warned)
(-little detail: there isn't any hint or key icon to show you that you can customise a bit your monarch at the very beginning of your save or when he's killed & get a successor)


To sum it up, more frustration or emptiness than enjoyment on this one (which is unfortunate, because it have a very nice potential).",False,1647523203

In my opinion this game is one of the highest quality games , thats including its visuals which are stunning. ive played this game for many hours (most of them being on  my switch) and i have very little to no complaints about it , the games ability to immerse its players into a world full of exploration and wonder compels me and every friend of mine ive played with to always come back to it , also a big part of the immersing experience is the beautiful alabi that compliments the game at its calmest to the most thrilling moments. Speaking of thrilling the game apart from being a relaxing and soothing expirience is also of course a fully fledged stratagy game , and in my opinion it fulfils its promise more than adequatly by desplying and challenging players with quick and of course exceptionally defficult encounters especially in its later stages. The conclusion being that with its impresive visuals and quality of music , its ability to immerse its players for days (depending on the frequency in which people play it) and the challenge it presents to either experienced or new players i think that if you like stratagy  2d or bit games , kingdom two crowns is a good way to pass the time relaxing or spending some time with a friend , would recommend.",True,1647463010

- Broken saves (restarted game at least once from beginning);
- Broken settings (can cause black screen at start up and break saves);

"This game is bs eventually you get to point where your stuck on an island in the winter, with minimal income, and constantly increasing waves, im not sure if the islands are randomly generated but it got to the point where I was in a perpetual loop of saving up money from my farmers and defending a wall tooth and nail once everything was killed I'd start running full speed with the stag mount just before dawn to the next wall 'which wasn't that far' however by the time the builders got to it they wouldn't get to build it for .0001 seconds before the next night hit killing the builders before they could even start hammering. this was fine for making temporary wooden walls, however, trying to get them to stone to give my army enough time to get there is impossible. forcing me to start over even though I could technically with enough time kill the eastern portal, the portals that let you teleport from one side of the island to another are cool but make no sense if my kingdom can never even get to the distance their located at to make them safe and making them portal doorways is useful but pointless since they can teleport you anywhere by default. The fact I'm forced to ng+ without being able to 100% the island i'm on is shitty game design especially for those people who like to 100% everything. Would not recommend for anyone with the common term of ""ocd"" not actual OCD obviously. or those easily enraged or have little patience. Uninstalling. Would rather play day 1 Cyberpunk on a ps3.

"Play graveyard keeper instead. I appreciate that this is one of those games that are loved by the fans, and I respect that, but I personally can't see it. IMO of course:

Really cool and interesting idea badly done: an RPG with tower defence mechanics. There's no way (at least that I can find) to undo decisions. Can't reassign builders to archers, archers ... etc. Four or five hours of your life, one wall section goes and if you loose the wrong guys, it's in reality over. Job roles are assigned.. god knows how they are assigned. I assume it's down the build order, which is where the problems set in. You can bank money, but it's useless if the population pick up the wrong left over items after an attack.

The tutorial consists of a ghost saying 'follow me' usually at totally random times, but it follows you instead, and then doesn't really tell you what's going on anyway. It does point the way, but you've probably already been using whatever it's trying to demonstrate for hours when it finally pops up. There is no real tutorial, which is always a bad sign in any game. Obviously you can search it, but those guides will do a wonderful job of spoiling the game soooo... yeah. It's not 'not hand holding you'   

The minimal UI is again a nice idea but isn't really practical. It's nice to not have the screen cluttered up with immersion breaking numbers but it comes down for example trying to eyeball how many pixel coins are left in the pouch for example. Why?

If you don't have any coins You will lose a crown instead of money.

"After many hours spent in all 3 Kingdom games, I've decided I've had enough of the games' crap.

The inability to accurately command your units is ridiculous. While it's obvious that it was set up this way due to the whole ""minimalist micro strategy game"" concept, consider simple things like: 
- being able to order your knights to abandon a march on the enemy spawn if you've sent them out accidentally or you've changed your mind on the feasibility of such an attack; 
- being able to prevent your idiotic builders to go out to build structures/cut down trees at *freaking DUSK* and subsequently get clapped by enemies at night;
- being able to direct your hermits (structure upgrading units) to go further inside the city so they aren't immediately captured as soon as the nearest city wall comes down.
Those are all bloody annoyances which'll just constantly boil your piss due to the AI being as minimalist in its intelligence as the game is in its control scheme. These issues could surely be remedied with a few more additions/changes, like say spending a coin to cancel an attack before it engages the enemy or making the builders' AI and night movement speed not on the level of a post-lobotomy snail. These problems have been in this series since Kingdom Classic, albeit of course many features (like for example hermits) weren't yet present in that one (at least as far as I remember).

The visuals are great, the soundtrack is nice, and the gameplay is addicting to play but if you're looking for a fair game that doesn't make you feel like you're driving a car with only 3 wheels just so it can preserve its Concept with no consideration for Fun or Challenge - look elsewhere.

Since I do like to actually finish games without feeling like they are unfairly screwing me over to prevent me from achieving that, I'm not gonna reccomend this one unless you can grab it on an irresistible sale. 
If you feel like you want to try this game nonetheless - Kingdom Classic is free and serves for a good trial of how lacking the AI and unit control are. If you find the above problems acceptable in that one, get this one.",False,1645549321

Two crowns is a bit more forgiving than previous one because you don't lose all your progress by losing the crown. Norse lands even more so, as those vikings stand their ground against the creep to the point that they aren't so scary anymore. But it's still very challenging.

My personal favorite is when workers simply refuse to clear trees, well time to save+quit and load, because that fixes it. Stuck in everlasting winter, save+quit and load and it's instant summer. Want to destroy the enemy gate whit the catapult, well better not because it'll kill your troops and disengage!

The game provides two free DLCs: One only changes the texture into Japanese theme, and another one adds a bit of new features together as well. Besides the paid DLC Norse Lands (haven't tried yet), There aren't much ""new"" stuff to try out although the game requires somewhat repetitive gameplay over very long time.

"Quality and Attention to detail. That is the definition of this game.
It looks simple, the concept is simple, the execution is streamlined to a point where you can understand the basics and be set for your grand adventure to follow. Everything else is where the complexity becomes apparent.

This game is the equivalent of a city builder in a side-scroller view. Unlike Terraria (which some friends thought of when I described this part), the game has set places where you only invest and order the construction of structures than a free build choice. Sometimes it is limiting, but it teaches well pre-planning and working with the environment .
The themes and the buildings change between campaigns, the aesthetic changes as you build and upgrade. At some point, your very own special buildings even change depending on what upgrade you unlocked.

At first I knew of this game as a wave survival game back when it first launched, it took me a while to shake the feeling that it's not for me since I don't find much enjoyment in a time limit game that will rely a lot on efficiency and time management to complete. The campaign setting absolutely nails this, the island hopping and lineage system is something I have not seen anywhere else so far (with how your kingdom rises and falls and then rebuilds).

"If you are a fan of complex RTS/Turn based strategy games or RPGs be warned you will probably find this really boring.

Calling this a ""strategy"" game is misleading IMO - all you do is walk left/right to collect coins and purchase things you mostly have no idea what they do. Then you wait for it to play out, without much understanding of what you could have done better. 

Saying you get to ""defend"" is also misleading - you sit there and watch units you recruited attempt to defend. The player character cannot actually fight enemies or interact beyond spending coins. I was expecting to AT LEAST have some control over unit/building placement, but no.

To me a strategy game is about making decisions - and your decisions are very limited. I don't enjoy being idle waiting to find out if the thing I spent money on was a good decision or not.

"For context, I played through only the vanilla campaign, and my acquired hours are how long that took as of writing this review.

This game is very fun. I'm not sure what to compare it to, maybe old Flash games from Newgrounds or Kongregate where you would manage a town via upgrades while beating oncoming waves of enemies? It has that late 2000s flash game aura about it, which I find nostalgic.

The gameplay is very easy to pick up, as your only 4 buttons are A, S, D, and Shift. You are the ruler of a kingdom, but you are not a warrior. You recruit villagers to your cause and they assign themselves to whatever item you've laid out for them to use. They really fit into 2 categories, either a builder or some type of fighter. It's self-explanatory.

You make up a decent fort and have your AI allies defend for you. Most of the time, they do just fine. I've only have 1 major bug where builders were permanently pushing along fire barrels and refused to man the catapult. Other times, they behave just fine.

If you're deep enough into the game, you can get mounts with abilities that can help defend. Mounts also all have their own stamina and speed, but it doesn't tell you that in game--I found that out through the wiki. While the empty UI fits well aesthetically, sometimes I felt like I'd rather have a stronger explanation for things.

Graphically the game runs super well and looks fantastic for pixel art. Some of the animations are butter smooth and entrancing to watch them loop. The sound design is all right, but it's the music that really gets you into the atmosphere of the game. Amazing soundtrack.

Beware, though: the largest and most infuriating bug I've encountered is where I could not sail to an island no matter what I pressed. As you progress, you move to new islands, and the UI is just really, really bugged out. You can spam enter, space, left click to no avail, and no matter how many times you do it, you will not progress. The only fix I've found through pure accident is by spamming A or D and then moving back to which island I'd like to go to, and then it'll let me progress to the next island. Apparently, this bug has been a thing since like 2018 and has still not been fixed? How??? It was really aggravating and there's no clear solution around it.

"20USD, 25 hours of gameplay
Quite similar to New Lands, but now with multiplayer. The cute style quite harshly clashes with the story, but also paints a powerful image for how a once peaceful realm got taken by odd creatures. Normal mode on its own is difficult and challenging, as well as fun and strategic. However, if you found that mode easy, there are also the insanely difficult challenge modes to the game, bringing out an entirely different scale of hell. 
Very replayable as well. Im most definitely going to play more beyond now

accessibility-
While there are some auditory cues, they mostly come with visual ones that you need to look out for (the stars when a jumpy lad about to spawn)
Font can be a little odd to read, but its almost never bad to the point that you dont know what it says


There is a very minor glitch where a breeder comes out in the middle of the day and kills a few archers, slightly annoying but not deadly to the kingdom

First of all, the game itself is pretty nice, with beautiful environment, and super basics mechanics. Such a friendly game for any kind of people.

Moreover, there are a few thing to consider, one of them is that making progress in the game could be frustrating or repetitive, you have to always do the same and always build the same buildings and kill the same enemies, also, if you're advance in the game, you will still progressing super slow, and that NEVER changes. Even in the DLC's, SO REPETETIVE. 

To conclude, the game is good, but just to play it a few hours with your partner until you get bored of it. So i recommend you to buy it in case you're a casual player. Not for the ones that want a complex and complete management/strategy game.

"Extremely happy to be able to update my previously negative review! I greatly enjoyed Two Crowns, but I hit a gamebreaking bug that has since been patched out. I now have no qualms at all recommending this game, and I'm very grateful to the devs for their continued diligence. Players spoke, and they listened - that counts for a lot to me, and I think it should count for a lot to you too. 

My problems with (and praise of) the game are displayed below for posterity, but ***please be aware that the bugs I describe below no longer apply.*** Every single issue I mention is now outdated, much to my delight. The game is great! The devs deserve your money! Go play it!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is a provisional downvote, because I really enjoy this game but it has bugs that can keep you from completing it. I will flip or delete this review if they're addressed.

Two Crowns is a well received spin on the Kingdom games, in that incremental progression is rewarded, making this much more of a roguelite than its previous versions. This change is well implemented, and it makes a failed run feel much more meaningful than it once did. The problem is that for some reason, the game REALLY doesn't want you to switch areas once the lategame hits.

I didn't have any problems early on, but once I got to the point where I needed to visit my previously conquered areas in order to prepare myself for the final island (which is appropriately difficult and requires preparation), the game refused to let me do so. Each new run starts in the same area, and trying to sail away from that area is an exercise in pointless frustration. The map that allows you to choose which island to travel to becomes completely broken, allowing you to switch your view from island to island, but preventing you from actually confirming where you want to go.

At this point, a full quarter of my playtime has been spent preparing my party to sail to another area, then upon setting sail frantically alt+tabbing out, hitting space, the down arrow key, or the left mouse button (all three of which should move me to the new area), or just desperately hitting escape because I'm sick and tired of nothing happening, which restarts me at the first island. This adds time to my counter, and makes the final area even more difficult. I finally managed to get myself to the last island by doing all of this, but I had wasted so much time in getting there that I hit a Blood Moon, which means I had no time to set up defenses before a nasty wave annihilated my base. At that point, I erased my file out of frustration - it was the only thing I could do to spite the game the way it had spited me.

The game is fun. Lots of fun. If you don't care about actually finishing a run, then I'd say buy it. But if you want the gratification of clearing out all of the islands - you know, like the game wants you to - then I would hold off until a fix is patched in. The inability to do something as basic as switch areas without hours of restarts is simply unacceptable - even more so when you consider how long the game has been out. There is simply no excuse for this.",True,1640496581

"Talk about a let down...

There are two redeeming qualities of this game:
1. pixel graphics
2. music

The AI is the worst garbage that have no idea whether to go to the left or right side of the map and then all meet up on one side leaving the other side defenseless. Luckily you can tell them to attack or tell them where to go if they don't know where to go... oh wait nope you can't do that. You just let them sit there wasting time and being worthless.

Other huge problem with this game is leveling up to a new island... it's just boring. You put all this time and effort into going to a new island and then you basically start off at square one with no money. And then the game sends the biggest wave of enemies you've ever seen to wipe you out.

Also love how you can literally do nothing besides hope that your garbage AI archers will go and hit something at least 1 out of 50 arrows tend to hit their targets.

Could have been a fun game but buggy ai, no ability to attack, and resetting to ground zero after getting to a new island makes the game feel very boring after a couple hours.",False,1640302011

When one of the more recent patched came out I started to hate the game until the community gave me some solid pointers (the most important being that death is part of the game, a mechanic I've come to love). I recall being unimpressed with the screenshots when this game came out, but man, this game is hauntingly beautiful.

"I want to love this game because of 
+ great pixel art
+ from super simplistic controls (5 keys are all you need) come complex mechanics
+ interesting roguelite approach


But I hate it because of 
- very poor balance of enemy retaliation. The rest is reset when you die but enemies taking revenge for (mandatory) portal-destruction stay on the same level, meaning you get utterly crushed again and again until you lose. It's a no-win-possible scenario. 
And yes, you HAVE to destroy some portals to advance.
- bad design when returning to previous islands. Towers and walls are gone mostly (which is fine, you can rebuild) but also your villagers have lost all their tools, meaning a long and tedious phase of re-equipping each time this happens


Yes, you can deploy proven cheese tactics (search Youtube) but it should be possible in the regular game not to run into a dead end all the time.

So: great aesthetics and very fun concept but poorly balanced. Can't really recommend if you are serious about winning. If you like to just relax and run around and inevitably lose, get it.",False,1639133934
"So Two Crowns is basically a sort of side-on 2D tower defence base builder. I have the game on PC, mobile and switch, and the vast majority of my gameplay is on Switch; but in general all versions are pretty much the same in terms of gameplay, so what I've learned from Switch applies fairly well here too. I've also played the original (and a tiny bit of New Lands), so don't put much stock in my hour count.

Firstly, don't let the graphics fool you. Though by all means, for a pixel game, KTC is beautiful (the water reflections especially get me every time I play). KTC may look simple - and indeed, the controls and basis for the game are pretty simple - but there is a lot more to it than appears on the surface. Each island is randomly generated, and terrain features may make you have to mix up strategy somewhat, for instance. And gameplay gets progressively more complicated and harder as you progress through the islands. It will probably take a few attempts to get everything down, so if the game seems too hard at first, it does eventually come to a point where you can learn to get on top of things and stay ahead of the curve.

If there is one key word I would apply to KTC, it is 'unforgiving'. A misstep cannot be undone (except by killing the executable before the next autosave and loading up again). The game autosaves regularly and there is no undo button. Accidentally mark a tree for cutting that makes a vagrant camp disappear? Tough. Granted, it's not as fatal an error as it was in previous games, because KTC is designed so you can more readily recover, even if your mistake still means you're at a disadvantage to how you previously were.

So how does this compare to other versions of Kingdom? Well it's sort of like Kingdom + 2 expansion packs + various DLC follow-ups. Ordinarily, re-releasing the whole game after a lot of new features feels kinda sucky, but it's a cheap indy game, so it can be forgiven. And it does feel like Two Crowns is the definitive version, so unless a Kingdom 2 comes out, you'd probably be safe getting it. I do wonder whether some of the changes brought through from older versions of the game were such that they couldn't be made as expansions due to substantial changes to code (to allow for multiple islands and multiplayer). I'm sure the devs have their reasons.

Replayability comes from the follow-up stuff like Dead Lands and Norse Lands. Add-ons that add new factions. Each new faction seems to get progressively more unique (if you look at the Shogun faction, for instance, you'll see it has a lot more in common with the basic faction than the Norse faction does). To the extent where there are new challenges and new strategies involved.

So take all of the aforementioned details, add in a great soundtrack and really addictive gameplay, and you have this.",True,1639078917

- 2 or 4 PVP, GREED VS MONARCH :D 
- Adding a six island in each dlc so after we finish the game, the 6'th island will be a ""set your day challenge""m it will count to a more playability and challenging.

"I do not have the capacity to explain it in detail at this time, but the quick takeaway is I cannot recommend this game. Good concept, but having to fight glitches/bugs and the occasional bit of anti-player design ruins the experience and makes it drag into terribleness. If you have hearing issues, please be advised that there are key cues that are audio-based without any caption options. If you are colorblind, you will find the visual design even more challenging/impossible and again, there are no accessibility options. Considering that settings rarely stick between game loads, I'm not even sure that adding them would even fix anything. Also, adding new achievements at a later time and locking them behind a paid DLC is not great. In any case, sorry, but I would advise avoiding.",False,1638670914

"An extreme repetitive game with no variety and no strategical depth. Nothing really.
Most of the gameplay is running from the left to right.
The aesthetics loose their value the second you rebuild the same buildings over and over again.
The resource management aspect of the game is basically completely irrelevant after you understood the concept.

The only time I died was on accident, I was in a portal frame I build, scrolling YET AGAIN in slow speed through the map to quick travel. Well great thing is you are vulnerable  while seeing a completely different area of the map. You don't get any indicators that you are being hit. The game only scrolls back to your initial position when you already died.
Which is great because it only resets 80% of the progress that had no variety in the first place ,so you can repeat the same thing over again.

I agree with the negative reviews.
This game feels like a demo in an alpha stage, with no clear direction what it want to be. It has DLCs and multiple game modes. They seem to be some reskins to over-world and buildings.
It is insanely overpriced, I'm not even considering the ""extra content"" that they charge as well.

"The game can be fun once it works properly. It has nice pixel graphics. Unfortunately, its mechanics are terribly bugged, making it sometimes unplayable. Things, like builders, may stop working suddenly - they tend to vanish out of the blue or just run toward enemy, or just stay in place our of the city walls - and you notice it only when you get wrecked, because some wall was not build or else.
Moreover, the user interface is just bad. Things like cancelling orders or changing priorities of actions for minions should part of any well designed management game, even if for usability. 
Instead you miss-click something and your whole game session may be wrecked. What else? 
There are also problems with saving system, or rather lack of it. There supposed to be autosave, but when my  game crashed, that kingdom was lost. Couple of time I had resumed on different island from scratch, or same island but all building destroyed and with workers but no tools in hands. That, itself, invalidated couple of hours of my gameplay, and happened a few of times. I am guessing, one can avoid this problem by making additional backups of save files, but it is tedious process. Proper save mechanics, at least with checkpoints should be implemented here.
In general, there is a lot of issues in this game which often spoil the fun. And most of the issues I found exist there since 'classic' version, has not been resolved even in latest Norselands DLC. This is really mind-boggling to me why the author does not see it or prioritise fixing at least the more annoying issues and bugs.
In summary, I was pretty enthusiastic about this game. However, after dozens of hours with this and previous version, it became rather unsatisfying and frustrating experience due to broken interface design and mechanics.",False,1638578459

The game needs a difficulty setting. I'm not finding this game relaxing, its more of a micromanagement nightmare. And the constant back and forth is a little tedious.

"It's been years since I found a game so absolutely engrossing to play. Every aesthetic consideration in the game is totally excellent and polished. The game mostly lets you figure things out on your own, which works really well because the systems are mostly pretty simple and comprehensible (you don't end up being expected to figure things out that require an unreasonable amount of mental heavy lifting). The occasional bits of tutorialization from the ghosts of past monarchs could be a little annoying in a couple cases; occasionally I'd follow the ghost only to have them tell me about something I already knew, or try to get me to do an upgrade I couldn't afford or that I wasn't carrying the necessary hermit for. I was also a little miffed to realize super late in the game that some mounts have special abilities that are triggered by left-shift. Not sure if there was anything I missed to tell me about that in-game, but if I hadn't googled some other stuff about mounts I would never have found it out. Other than those minor complaints, I found the game extremely immersive, relaxing, and satisfying to sink a surprising amount of hours into.

"I've enjoyed all the Kingdom games, even though I suck at them. Two Crowns in particular is forgiving of failure because you start a new reign, but much of your progress remains in tact - while the towns you've established may suffer some decay, they remain established. Any money or gems you've banked also remain, which makes rebuilding very swift indeed. It really does play as though you are the heir to the previous ruler, rather than starting over from scratch. I like that continuity.

And of course, this game has multiplayer, which makes some things easier but adds additional challenges (especially if you like to micromanage your kingdom). It's only one other person, but that one other person can make a world of difference, especially in the late game. Just make sure you have some kind of voicechat on - if the Greed have broken through on your partner's side of the town, text will not be fast enough to alert you.

But the Conquest update definitely gave some great changes, and grabbed my nomination for the 2021 Labor of Love award. Even if you haven't bought the Norselands expansion yet, there's lots of good stuff going on. No more permanently losing archers to towers as your town expands; now they'll leave it to join the forces at the outermost wall if that wall is out of bow range. If you have to tear down a vagrant camp as you expand, you can build a citizen house in its place. New people don't show up as quickly, and cost a good deal more to hire than the camp residents did, but at least new people can still be obtained. And honestly, once you get a few farmers working, money ceases to be an issue.

I haven't gotten a chance to get the Norselands myself yet - and frankly, the new Greed crabs scare me! - but I'm looking forward to it. Meanwhile, I'm thoroughly enjoying the new update and trying to get that ""clear all islands in a single reign"" achievement.

Invisible coins.
Coins falling out of a non-full bag.
Banker refusing to give money to one of the two players, even with an empty bag and a hefty amount in the bank.
Farmers refusing to harvest berry bushes that are nowhere near a portal.
Mount abilities failing to function.

Builders and farmers ignoring orders until the game restarts.
Farmers starting new plots of land instead of maintaining plots of land where the crops are dying.
Builders, archers, and farmers, after getting their tool knocked away by Greed, not picking the tool back up the next day.

In addition, there are plenty of obtuse gameplay decisions, like inability to cancel orders, builders and farmers running to their death (or stopping outside the kingdom walls), the banker only remaining open for a couple of hours and spewing coins whenever I look at him.

"BUGGY GAME but enjoyable, requires patience.

After several years it's still buggy and still needs a better interface. The UI is lazy and overly simplistic, even just adding cancel,demolish or disembark would help. Communication is crap, you have to learn by trial and error especially with the hermits and how unit function.

-Can't cancel or demolish buildingSome walls will cut off farm land and choke your income. 

-Trees will hide behind each other (especially in Shogun) and accidentally cutting them down will cause  you to lose vagrant camps where you draw your population. 

-Some buildings will be built way too close to each other and overlap thus leading to issues when paying coin to activate or restock which then leads to things like: Accidentally ringing the bell on the boat will make your knights jump in said boat and you won't be able to attack Greed portals and advance forward. 

-Builders enjoying the night sky too outside the walls after sundown and Archers venturing too far from the walls 

-Can't transfer troops from a cleared safe side to the other side

There are a lot more issues but this would turn into a novel. 

Lots of things could be solve with a cancel button but the devs are lazy. So when playing you have to be extremely careful about expansion and every tap of the keyboard even though the map generation is pretty stupid sometimes like walls being too close to farm and the next wall or clearing being a hundred miles away. There's also the farm that's placed between two bridges and is practically useless because it can't generate farm tiles.

Fun game but lots of flaws.

"The games are great. I play a lot it's on Nintendo Switch. but i don't recommend because of a bug in this game.
Normally i don't care much about bug. Unless i got is a bad one. And this one i can't even play this game.

After i link my account for save cloud (Yes! very cool feature to continue your game on another platform). The game is stuck when i boot-up a game. It stuck at a black screen with a engineer on the center of screen. I tries reinstall, verify a game, delete a save game. I also tries stare at the screen in hopeless (it's 1.2 hours of not fun). and It's not work.

What make the matter worse is support website. it's been 3 days. No one respond me even a single bot.
And this bug is noting new. I saw some guy in steam forum have exactly the same problem over a year ago. (https://steamcommunity.com/app/701160/discussions/0/2998794978547613408/)

It's ideal to chill for a few hours and just relax, very peaceful.
Looks good, feels good, is good. 

However some criticisms~
After a while moving around the map becomes a chore, sure there are portals and mounts to help alleviate the issue, but it's still present. I think simply adding the ability to teleport to the centre of the map after a 3 second channel every few minutes or so would help.

The game is very simple, which is nice in way; you only really need three buttons to play. However the natural progression of the game leaves you wanting more, it feels like a great foundation to add more onto, however i feel that was not the vision of the developer. Just, as i was starting to really get into it and enjoy it; i hit the ceiling of what was possible and sort of felt a little confused and disappointed.

Overall, amazing little game but do note that it is very simple and ideal to relax with, not dig your heels into a complex city builder.",True,1637751832
I have played Kingdom for around 4 years. Ever since I saw a play through on Youtube I have been following the game. The first time I played was the IOS version on my iPad. Later on down the road when I got a computer I bought the game and started playing again. When Two Crowns came out I introduced my friend to the game and he loved it. We played the game a lot and had so much fun. We played every version that came out and continued to love the game and where it was going. When Norse Lands dropped we were ecstatic that we could play as Vikings and in the Norse setting. The Premium DLC was well worth the money and was by far the best introduction to the game.

There's literally only four keys to use (sometimes a fifth; you will only be using three for the majority of the game), can be played solo, but is made easier if you go co-op. My wife and I play this a lot together with Murder, She Wrote on another monitor.

"[h1] A really amazing sequel [/h1]

Kingdom Two Crown the third game of kingdom which started as dlc of new lands became a standalone game, i have played and finished new lands about six months ago so i was quite hyped for playing this game

Playability

Overall it is really similar to new lands but it adds even more features and reworks of certain mechanics, believe if you tough that the ia of new lands was an improvement from kingdom in this one you will be blown away by how clever you little peasent have become (though not enought to deathrone you)

If you expect a more difficult version of kingdom than new lands there is a option campaign that can make your life hell but apart from that the game is a lot easier because of the heir system when you die your kingdom will stay similar to when you died exept from some archers and walls and it resets the difficulty waves making the greed sometimes feel like they are taking you as a joke, blood moons are almost not existant which is a shame and when there are they are so few that the revenge waves get harder by at least 20x than them if you want to go hardcore try to go to the there is no greater ruler than you achivement there is a better spike difficulty like that


The new form of unlockables is way better for new players tough you cannot have all of them because there are only 35 of 38 necessary things for them and they are finite so take care of them like their are your child or something

Between the reworks is the weapons for your peasants remeber those times where you didn't built a single wall because they were useless and sometimes make your kingdom worse well now you have to because you won't have catapults if you don't but it adds more meaning to them so it is good you no longer need to fear not having peassents to contract though it becomes EXPENSIVE but really

If you liked kingdom or new lands you surely will love this one and be surprised by things i didn't mention here

Features that i would aprecciate 

more save files: each campaign requires a save file slot which are only 3 which is not enough for the four campaigns and if you want to go 100% get anoyying really fast

"85% of your time is spent walking back and forth in a base that is just too large to get around.  The game adds teleports to try to make it seem better but its just like walking forever.  You might as well just watch a repeating gif of someone riding on a horse and it would be the same game play as this game.  Seems like its only viable if you do co-op?  Then you can have one person take each side of your base and spend less time walking?  All the streams I've seen are people playing co-op.  I only saw two streams but they were both co-op and the people playing seemed to be sorta enjoying it.  I guess if you don't have a dedicated friend to play with on this game just don't?  Not sure if the co-op is any better actually, seemed like even watching streams of co-op it was like 85% walking back and forth.  Don't get me wrong the walking back and forth looks cool its just like when you're on hour 4 or 6 and you're like ok, i need to go to the other side now, and then you take 7 minutes going from one side to the other its just like man... this game takes forever to achieve nothing. 
 I need to stop wasting my time playing this game holy cow this is just a walking simulator.  It wears on you hard.  The first island it seems like things are cool and you're only a bit tired of walking, by the time you finish out the second island its like dude this takes way way way too long to walk back and forth omg i want to not have to do this anymore.  By the third island its like just kill me please i'm so tired of walking back and forth. 
 Its in all other regards a great game, except the levels are too large to walk through lol.  The game would be great if they just smushed the levels so they were much smaller.  I don't understand why they made walking long distances the core gameplay mechanic but it is.",False,1637561002

I was playing it again today after a few months, and I made a new game with the regular version of the game. However, some how, I ended up on another savefile when I entered the 4th island. The game sent me to the Norselands campaign I'd played a few months back. Yes, a new game that some how sended me to an older game file on another world. If you're confused, this game has many different versions. You have the original standard version. You hava a japonese style version called Shogun, you have a viking themed version called Norselands and you have a sort of zombie version which i forgot the name. They are all slightly different. I was playing the standard version and ended up in the Norselands. This should not be able to happen. 
The game files are saved in a cloud, but the service is trash. It only allows 3 save files, and If you play from different PCs, it won't necessarly sync the save files, even though it should.

"Amazing game and very unique in terms of gameplay. With that said I don't think I'll play this game beyond first clear, because movement speed is atrociously slow and I keep getting bored/impatient every time I have to make 2-4 minute run across the entire map (that is 2/3 of all gameplay).

[h1]Simple, but enticing gameplay[/h1]
The gameplay itself is remarkably simple. Move left/right (vertical mobility), deposit coins (by pressing down) to build/interact with various objects/building, sometimes wait for workers to complete the task you ""paid"" for and collect coins (by moving on them) that drop on the ground as you interact with stuff. Yes, you only need 3 buttons.

[h1]A few micromanagement options would be nice[/h1]
There are ways to screw up (like sending builders too far away from home, so they have no chance of returning safely) and there is no way to cancel actions, recall people, undo a permanent upgrade to a tower. You can recover from some of those mistakes (like lost worker), but downgrading a tower is impossible, so if you upgrade it the wrong way, you're screwed...

What's needed
[list]
[*] Drop Hermit. Holding a hermit locks you into a specific ugrade for certain buildings. Those upgrades are mostly situational buildings with heavy downsides. To drop a herming you either need to upgrade a building or travel outside of safe zone (takes a while to reach by the time you get access to hermits).
[*] Cancel - undo coin investment before building starts
[*] Downgrade - option to downgrade from structures that are not a plain upgrade. There are many reasons do it.
[*] Call/Recall workers - Often times I get them to cut a tree, and they just wait there until night comes and I have no way to call them back.
[*] Re-allocate troops from side to side. This one's simple. Game will sometimes put too many troops on one side, while the other side has a really bad defense situation (like wall with no nearby towers and a portal).
[/list]

[h1]The game is SLOW[/h1]
If I could I would skip about half of the game, because I've spent it slowly running from 1 side of the map to the other, waiting for something to finish. I didn't mind it at first, while I had scenery or animations to experience, but that got old and the game is still having me wait for like a minute at a time.

A time flow (time speed) slider would be nice to skip the boring parts.

[h1]Multiplayer advantage[/h1]
Multiplayer gameplay is basically identical to single player (no scaling), BUT now you get the advantage of controlling (or being in) 2 places at once. 
You also don't instantly lose if your crown gets stolen, but I personally didn't find keeping the crown on my head a big challenge. There are, however a few achievements where this might come in handy.

With that said, whether you're playing solo or with a somebody else, I recommend being in multiplayer at all times, and building left with 1 controller and right with the other. It will save you hours of running time per playthrough.



[h1]RNG (I think) can be really bad[/h1]
At some point on 4th island I realized there's a massive stretch of land with no spots for building walls. That is a problem, because troops only defend outer-most wall, and only start moving towards it after it gets built. Builders barely had enough time to reach the next wall spot. It took me 6 attempts before I could establish a tier 3 wall, that doesn't evaporate from the enemy looking at it, and I still had to sacrifice troops to protect the wall from being destroyed in about 5 seconds.

I don't think that was intended, because I didn't have such a hard time anywhere else in the entire game.

EDIT: After completing the game i realised there are way too many bugs for my money. Id say an average of 1 bug per island at least. Eg. various bugs via mounts powers, a builder floating sideways above a house, endless blood moon with no enemies (except a greed petrified in front a porthole) and spirits in the coin purse clogging the opening so no coints could get in after reloading a save. Good news is some bugs will vanish if you save and quit/reload.

"Kingdom Two Crowns is a town builder / defense game that thrives on a horizontal perspective of the world.  This is a game in a series of Kingdom games, however they're not sequential and if you want the full game you're best off getting this one.  Difficulty is Medium.  Played using the directional arrows on a keyboard.  Took me roughly 16ish hours to play through the regular mode of Kingdom Two Crowns by itself.  

- Play one of three worlds: Kingdom Two Crowns, Kingdom Shogun, or Kingdom Bloodst- er, Deadlands.  The first two are similar in terms of gameplay with a variation to the pixels and the land you're in.  Deadlands takes characters from the game BloodStained and each has a power you can use to help you.  

- There are challenge modes!  If you've thoroughly conquested your heart out against the greed and want more, this game packs not one Skull island, but multiple challenge modes you can try out.  The challenges are much harder than the main game.  

- There is now a Norselands version of Two Crowns as well for a little extra!  

- This is the sort of game series that doesn't really hold your hand outside of basics.  There is a ghost who will show up and point out specific things you could do to keep from dying in certain situations, which is far more helpful than in previous games.   However the ghost can also distract you.  If you're new to Kingdom expect to die a lot in the beginning.  Once you get good, the game will pull you in for hours of entertainment.  That said, Two Crowns is by far the easiest of the Kingdom series (in a good way).

- There are three saves to use if you want to try each world without losing your last.  The challenge modes additionally have their own save file separate from the main game. 

- The graphics are pixelly!  This and the 'only able to go left and right' mechanic might turn off people who aren't into a micromanaging sort of tedium.  Personally, I love it.  So there you go.

- The music is awesome and entirely worth it.  You'll get three full soundtracks for your moneys' worth.  

- Once you get into it, this game can be ADDICTIVE!!! and TIME SUCKING!!!  Hours can fly by without warning.  

- There is a dog.   Woof Woof. 

- After a decent fourty odd hours playing, I finally experienced a bug where people got stuck in one pixel-spot and couldn't get all the way to the village to grab their items - instead running in one place spastically two steps short of the main building without getting anywhere.  This ended up killing my game.  The game also slowed down weirdly previous to this when the ghost tried to tell me about light houses, so maybe it's related.  But that was the only bug I experienced and it only happened once.  And it was really weird.  




I love the kingdom games and fully recommend them hands down.  This is the best Kingdom game by far, has all sorts of additional dlc gameplaying, has an awesome OST, and the only reason I stopped playing at all was because my life was being sucked away in a relentlessly fun battle against the Greed.  Worth it. The best part is the DeadLands mode and I love the tie in with Bloodstained.",True,1637279187

"UPDATE (post patch) ---  

I've noticed, since posting on the forum and posting this review, that Kingdom has turned into the kind of game the attracts the worst kind of players ... the ""git gud"" players, the ""shutup and get better"" players, the ""easy games are for pussies"" players etc. The forum for Kingdom has turned into this place where asking for BALANCE, FAIRNESS, CUSTOMIZABLE DIFFICULTY, and an enjoyable experience is met with anger, hatred, even ableist commentary and mental health snide remarks about people who are ""weak"" or ""stupid"" for enjoying games that aren't stressful ... The entire experience just leaves a bad taste in my mouth about a game which I use to enjoy. When you make changes to a game and it completely brings out the worst kinds of gamers ... that's a bad sign of things to come. Kingdom use to be a great gaming experience ... but after everything I have seen (even snark from the devs themselves), I will no longer be supporting any paid additions to this franchise.
Devs want the game to actually appeal to a very specific group of gamers ... maybe they feel the need to compete with a market that focuses on puzzling, tedious, hardcore gameplay, I have no idea but Kingdom has become a game for a niche of gamers and not a casual, challenging, beautiful experience like it use to be. 

ORIGINAL Review ---

I have loved Kingdom since it's first iteration. I have played all the DLC and I have always loved how the game was just the right balance of challenging and fun ... but Norse Lands is just not fun at all and is punishing without being rewarding.

The developers have pretty much said they didn't like how everyone was playing the game before (using a ton of archers) and have decided to ensure that doesn't work anymore by nerfing walls and archers so you are forced to play more ""actively"". Suggesting that I am lazy or that gamers are lazy in how they play a game is a sure way to get me to refund this but the fact that they chose to make the greed stronger and you weaker because they didn't want to figure out how to rebalance the game so people didn't just use archers is what is truly lazy. 

Forcing people to play the game the way you want them to play (or forcing them to coop) and giving them no choices in strategy doesn't make a game ""different"" ... it just makes it not fun anymore.",False,1637158799
This game is a masterpiece. It has been so fun playing it over the last several years as it has evolved from the original title up through 2 crowns and all of the expansions. Norse lands expansion is the jewel of two crowns ;). Love the simple gameplay that still manages to have a huge amount of depth. Love the sound track. Love the art. Love the progression/story.

"Norse Lands brought with it the conquest update where they nerfed the player and buffed the enemies.

[strike] Not only was this wholly unnecessary, it made playing the game just tedious. Specifically in the Norselands campaign (the only paid content outside of the base game), there is just too much you HAVE to do within very tiny windows of time that the game all but punishes you for daring to play.

Its clearly overtuned, too say the least, but it's also unnecessary. Norselands is already more difficult because of a reliance on melee troops (which are very prone to dying), and the expenses required to build up your base are much higher then the other modes. 

I would recommend this game to anyone, but as it stands the game barely lets you play past the third island before brutally and untiringly wiping your pitiful kingdom off the map.

Wait for a balance patch, its pretty clear they didn't want it to be this hard (imo at least) I mean, Island 2, day 45 for me and my gf and we had to start from scratch because a single crab took out all our walls and we spent more then an hour trying to direct the crab the right way so our singular remaining archer could take it out. That's just not fun.[/strike]

This was changed in game within a few weeks of release. They have vastly improved how troops behave, how tanky the catapult replacing beserkers are, and how fast the game ramps up. This is enough for me to invert my initial review, and the changes have made Norselands one of the best settings to choose for even an initial playthrough.

"One of my all-time favorite games. Beautiful graphics and (the ONLY) soundtrack that I find myself coming back to almost every day. A fantastic co-op experience to share on cozy nights or to unwind after a long day. 

Don't get me wrong. The Greed will demolish your beloved kingdom if you let your guard down for even a second. The ominous sounds and blood moons will put you on edge, and you'll wonder how your defenses are faring (after all, you can't be everywhere at once). There is a sense of urgency as the difficulty increases with time and winter approaches.

However, the real beauty of this game is that hope is never truly lost. After hours of conquest, you may be overcome despite your efforts. Worry not! A new ruler will soon come along to carry on your legacy.

There are various townsfolk, hermits, mounts, and enemies to discover, each with their own traits/abilities. Explore islands and discover treasure, mysterious portals, rideable creatures, and more. And, once you've seen all there is to see in the original campaign, try Dead Lands, Shogun, or the new Norse Lands for a brand new world to fall in love with.

"I really want to like this game... there's harvesting, upgrading, defense and expansion... all the elements I enjoy in my favorite games... but the RNG nature of the islands, combined with the game basically being designed to make you restart quickly saps away my desire to continue playing.

more often than not I find myself restarting the campaign over and over because the first few islands literally fucked me over with RNG stinginess... which does not make for an enjoyable game experience, its called ""tedious"" ...which basically sums up this game, sadly.

I often find myself with a bunch of gems and coins, but no meaningful structures to invest them in... and i guess if the developers were to adjust the level of RNG placement of necessary resources on the first few islands, it would totally fix my issues with this game... but I'll probably have to rely on the community to mod it in.

If these issues get fixed I'd probably recommend it, but I absolutely cannot condone a game that basically forces the player to reset all their progress and 'try again' because their island didn't spawn the necessary resources to advance.

And as others have stated, an 'undo' button [like ""up"" ??? an otherwise UNUSED button] seems like a huge oversight... what king never changed their mind?

----2025 update----
you used to be able to chang your Ruler's apperance before starting a playthrough and the game would give you a wide range of options on appearance, male, female, different skin and clothing colors... now the game has paywalled most options behind DLC packs, even options that used to be in the original game.

Totally avoid, the developer is trying their hardest to monetize every single aspect of this otherwise mediocre and very bare-bones game because they know the core gameplay is just meh.

It is however slow and some of the mechanics are so frustrating they're borderline broken. Giving and receiving coins is just bad. It only works about half the time. If you try to deposit coins in your coffer but theres other civilians around they will pick your coins up and instead the magistrate will withdraw your coffer coins and youll have to redeposit them. The mounts run out of stamina way too fast. If your in your huge ass castle and run out of stamina infront of your farmers better hope your coin bag isnt full cause they will drop all their coins and half of them will go in the water. Honestly mounts shouldnt use stamina in your castle walls especially with how big it gets. You could literally just add a button that asks for coins though and solve all these frustrations.

"Short version:
- Basically tower defense done at its best.

Long version:
- During the day you explore the current island (yes, there are several).
- Build up your defenses in the form of recruiting peasants for your army and build walls/towers.
- Survive the night when the Greed come (a well named enemy that steels your coins).
- Unlock new building/peasant tech and rid-able mounts on the current island.
- Build a ship.
- Move to the next Island.
- Repeat former steps until strong enough to return to the first Island.

- Rebuild your damaged defenses and lost forces on former played island.
- Destroy the Greed on that island.
- Repeat for other Islands until the Greed has been banished forever.
- You won the game.

- Repeat all steps for every other (mostly free) DLC which play differently enough not to get boring.
- Realize this has multiplayer.
- Have all the same fun with friends.

- Write a review for one of the best tower defenses you ever played.

Now I left out that between most steps there is DYING, a lot of it because you learn how the Greed works, what events may pass, and basically how everything works until you don't die anymore. When you do die the cost is some damage to your defenses and forces which can easily be undone.

It's just so much fun discovering all the things to unlock and how things work in this world. Even after 100+ hours and basically knowing every event and game mechanic. The game still remains fun to do a complete run and see how quickly you can beat it again. The challenge is always there because of the random generated islands not to mention the challenge mode island also included in the game.

TL;DR: Then do read the first line, dummy.

"I love this game, Painfully. 
This game is so fucking broken, this 'strategy' game is ruined by consistent and well known bugs that make you tear your hair out, unfairly punish the player, or soft-lock the game. 

In every new game-style there are SOME of the essential bug fixes that make it much more playable, but those are NOT applied to the previous game-style. The latest and least-buggy is Norse lands, and even that is too fcked to play. If your not convinced, google the game-breaking issues. 
Oh and tutorials, the game doesnt tell you what things do until you find out by making a death-sentence mistake to find out, while Also having a tutorial-ghost show up to INSISTENTLY nag you to do something you've already done, lots. (ie, bank)
Oh and they also did the GREAT move of encoding the games saves, that means, if you DO encounter something dumb and game-breaking you CANT fix it. Do the devs hate us?? 
Oh, and you'll love winter, i bet people enjoy waiting an entire in-game season 'kicking dirt' until they can get back to PLAYing the game. 


I love it, but i do NOT recommend it. :( *UNless you just want to play on peaceful, then most issues wont be real problems.
Even if you do buy it, the only most-playable version is norse lands, the devs have abandoned the older versions. 
...
I cant wait to play Kingdom Eighties so i can love it and then probably find it too buggy to play and never really play it again. >_> 


(If devs fixed all the well-known-about bugs and soft-locks and (IE...) in current and past style-versions then i would do a backflip, and be recommending this game, and play it more.)

"An incredibly fun game. I recommend it to all friends and family.

The one improvement I would make is the ability to cancel a mark set upon a tree or any type of construction outside of your walls, but I'm sure something like that will come in time. The only reason that is an issue is because of accidentally hitting a button, not poor judgement. The penalty for that accidental button push, is too damned high, and can ruin a play-through.

Aside from that one issue, this is still one of my favorite games, and I will be purchasing 'Norse Lands' the hour that it drops.",True,1637009690
"First impression from game is that you play as a king or some sort of kingdom ruler but no. You will actually play as charity worker who moves from place A to place B to get money and donate money. That is, there is nothing else to the game. 

Game does not give you any info at all. Basic info such as how many archers, soldiers, peasants, etc. you have is missing. How are you supposed to know what unit types you need without this info? Partly due to this, It is also very easy to get soft locked as cannot even re-distribute roles. Why? What kind lousy king I am? And when you kingdom gets larger, you cannot send archers sitting in the middle towards edges of map to be useful. 

Recruitment is also mindbogglingly dumb. To get new peasants, you need to visit some camps but they will disappear if you expand towards them. So, you can end up  in situation where you should expand but you cannot, because if you do, you lose your peasant pool. Like, what? 

It is frustrating as game is close being quite good. But without some quality of life improvements, I cannot recommend this.

It's neither hard nor simple with a bitter taste of consequences of your choices (had to restart over 2 times). In total I've spend 23 hours for the whole playthrough and had a good time. 

What could be improved? I would say the winter. I do get that I could save up coins during the summer and blah-blah-blah... Nevertheless  there is no reason for it to be there in the first place, it's just annoying and boring. It does netheir increase the difficulty nor gives some things to do.

When I say 'simple' I of course don't mean to denigrate the maker - its the simplicity that makes it so good.  The pixel art is gorgeous and atmospheric, the soundtrack is surprisingly relaxing for a game where you're fighting for the safety of your entire kingdom (although it doesn't pull any punches when a blood moon occurs, when it turns terrifying and ominous).  The systems for building, defense, offense, and survival are all easy to pick up, but not so easy to master that you don't feel a challenge to make the right choices.

I'm delighted already with what little I've experienced of the Norse Lands addition and will happily add to my collection when available.  The update notes regarding improvements to all versions of the game show an excellent attention to detail in player feedback - rebalancing armies, improving NPC AI, fixing parts of the game that worked, but leaned toward being tedious after some time - I'm excited that in a couple of days the game's going to be a brand new play all over again!",True,1636942330

And what a lovely surprise that you get the Shogun and Deadlands for free.  I also just love the art style.  It's really well done, especially the reflections.  This series might be my favorite example of pixel art ever.  

The earlier games are fun.  I had fully moved on from 1 to 2, which was basically 1+.  This takes all the best of 2 and runs with it, so I'll probably just stick with this.  I bought it on steam sale, and you should too, but if I'd paid full price I'm sure we would have loved it then.  This game is perfect for my backyard projector!

"Two Crowns' fun for a bit but the relaxing vibe gives way to annoying difficulty ramps that betray its flash game origins. Once things have gone downhill, there's not really a way to correct aside from letting your current monarch take a dirt nap and start over--which the game frames in an unbearably twee iteration of the bane of modern indie game design: dying and starting over is all part of the fun! Well, no actually. Making meaningful choices in a reactive environment is part of the fun, noticing that you've been unknowingly screwed for the last half-hour is just frustrating. 

While I respect what the game does accomplish in terms of educating the player through allowing them to observe the game world, the interaction of this design choice with the aforementioned difficulty ramps doesn't mesh well. The degree to which a game can tutorialize the player through spending time in the gamespace alone should be measured by how long it takes for that player to flee to the wiki. For me, that was around 8 hours.

I'm surprised, upon reflection, that the soundtrack was used to convey so little to the player about the current state of play. The game does ebb and flow between varying degrees of threat to the player, but for some reason, music isn't used to communicate this. Instead, nice songs seem to play at random communicating varying levels of whimsy, which I wish the game had been more about instead of a secret and desperate race against the clock.

Anyway, it's a 'fun while it lasts' kinda game. I think it'd suit what it seems to be aesthetically going for more if it either toned down the degree to which you can be completely overrun with monsters or was more upfront about that being the actual focus of the game.",False,1636480639

"I just got trough with the Norse Lands demo. The art style and music are great, but there needs to be more diversity in the art. The walls blend in too much with the background. I usually only open the coin and gem chests when I really need them to make the game harder, but in this style they blend into the scenery and are less noticeable causing them to accidentally get opened.  It can also be difficult to tell at a glance if someone has been hired or assigned a job. Issue 2 and 3 may just require time to get more familiar with the new art. 

The new upgrades for builders and archers are nice visually, but anything that makes the characters suicidal has to be done carefully if at all. I never use the knight statue in the other games for this reason. These changes could be useful late game though when greed are overabundant and my money bag is overflowing. The AI overall seems better and I noticed a more defensive posture when things started to go bad, or there was more danger. They were better at advancing to the next location when the walls were extended. I tend to expand aggressively to leave large sections of wood for spawning deer and keeping the villages. Nothing like building a wall and the archers don't show up to defend it until the next morning.

The tutorial needs updating across all versions, and if I skip it the ghost needs to stay in the grave not bug me every 5 minutes telling me to do something I've already done. 

In summary did I enjoy Norse Lands? Yes. Is it worth paying for? Yes. The core game is still Two Crowns with a reskin but there are multiple tweaks/additions. In my opinion it is enough to justify a DLC price for it. Developers can't afford to keep working on a game that is generating no profit and this game is not expensive and deserves to be expanded. It would be nice if developers would announce what if any price there will be for it though. I have seen multiple questions on it from multiple people on the discussion boards, but no answer from the developers that I have seen.",True,1635280380

There isn't some guidebook to tell you (save for the wiki) but that makes figuring the details of this world out so incredibly rewarding. This game hit the perfect sweet spot of having simple enough mechanics where you can figure everything out on your own, but making it vague enough so it feels great when you start mastering it. It took me a while to beat it, and it dragged a tiny bit at the very end, but that's just because I died and had to start over for a bit, so I was ready to be done.

"Arguably one of my favourite games. Its the type of game where there's restrictions and rules that the developers have embedded in the game but you also have enough freedom to do things your way and decide how you want to play. In-game there are moments when you're relaxed and your kingdom is thriving and there are moments when you are worried because some walls might not be up to their max level or that there arent enough archers. Truly a 10/10 when it comes to game design.
When it comes to the art i also really like it although i would like to see more diverse sprites/animation. For example when the builders go to chop a tree, they should have an axe rather than a hammer. Still really great though.

I mean that as in love/hate thing, but I would say as someone who came in blind to this little series of games, I was entirely lost and felt so powerless.  The AI seemed very clumsy and accident prone.  I was almost entirely turned off, but the game carried this sense of mystery, and it had such a wonderful atmosphere, it made the growing Greed a staggering enemy.  Once I realized how the game progressed in a basic sense, I was hooked.  Just don't worry about your first character... or two... dont let the first few losses get you down.  Oh, and if you're at a loss like I was at the start, just pay attention to the characters, even your mount(s).  They do a great job showing you what to do next without saying much.  Ghosts are usually very helpful too.  But if they tell me to fill my coffers again I'm gonna murder a ghost.",True,1634639716

"Yes. I definitely recommend this game.

While the subtitle is Two Crowns and has co-op, I've only played solo and it's pretty good.
This game is noticeably easier than the previous game New Lands. Personally I like that, but there's people who lament it. I can understand their disappointment, even though this title is more my speed. MOST of the time it feels like if I lose I messed up, but there's been quite a few instances I was frustrated with how some mechanics work.

A cool thing about K2C is that are 3 different themes. There's the standard medieval theme, the weeb Shogun theme (Asian/Japanese), and the Dead Lands theme which is a crossover with Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (a game I highly recommend.). There's a Norse version coming soon, it's not out yet at the time of writing this.
The main theme and the shogun theme are very similar. To my memory the only mechanical difference is instead of pikemen you recruit ninjas... which IMO aren't as good and aren't worth recruiting. But theme skin is cool.

Dead Lands, on the other hand, changes up quite a bit. Instead of being a generic monarch there are 4 specific ones each with their own special ability. The one you start with whips and causes a freezing wave a short distance in front of her which stops enemies from moving or attacking for a few seconds allowing you to run away, or your archers to thin their numbers. There's one that projects another you a short distance in front of you so when you use your mounts ability (more on that later) it's doubled separated just a little bit. Another turns you into a swarm of bats which allows you to travel extremely quickly. The last... I forget. I think he does something to your subjects. I never use him so I'm not sure. Most of the buildings are the same as DL, but there's an extra one that's like a giant stained glass you can to pay a couple coins to change characters. It cycles through the ones you're not using and you put in the coins on the one you want to be. It can occasionally change at the last millisecond leaving you as a character you don't want to be.

In the vanilla and shogun themes IIRC there's just 2 mounts with special abilities. The gryphon which can flap its wings and buffet foes backwards, and the lizard/salamander which breathes a gout of fire that persists on the ground for a few seconds and sets enemies on fire. Dead Lands has these, the others reskinned, and more. One creates a small plant barrier that can take a couple hits. Great to position yourself just behind your walls then use it just outside it between it and the enemies. Only 2 of them can exist at once. (4 if you use the twinning monarch)

Like I said there are annoyances, though thankfully one of them is being fixed in the next patch. Which leaves the fact your engineers will stand around a million miles outside your base with not doing anything and simply can't make it back and outrun the greed (the enemy) while trying. Arg.
But overall this is an enjoyable experience for me, most of the time pretty chillax even though I know everything I'm doing is to prevent hordes of foes from breaking my walls down stealing all my subjects tools, and taking my crown.

❌Later games can be boring and tedious (Long travel times on big islands)

This game is meant to be played with a friend, so definitely try to go in with someone. 
If you play alone it's simply too challenging and boring since you'll have to make long trips Left and Right.

"+ 1.Наличие коопа - большой плюс.
+ 2.Простое управление,позволяющее играть даже одной рукой(Правда зачем?).
+ 3.Хорошая цена игры.
+ 4.Бесплатные дополнения.Учитывая еще и низкую стоимость игры - просто подарок.
+ 5.Учитывая бесплатность дополнений и цену игры,она всё еще поддерживается,выпускаются новые дополнения и обновления.

= 1.Кооп заставляет желать наличие коопа и в других частях серии,чего видимо не будет.

- 1.Невозможность отмены своих действий.Как по мне,это самый большой минус,который я просто терпеть не могу.
1.1.Во время бега от жадности пару раз строил НЕНУЖНЫЕ МНЕ СТЕНЫ из за того,что кидал монеты,чтоб откупиться.Потом приходилось ждать и рисковать,надеясь что волна жадности снесёт ненужную стенку первого уровня.
1.2.Чтобы зарабатывать больше монет,вырубаю все деревья вокруг лагеря,до ближайшего лагеря нищих,оставляя там одно крайнее дерево.Пару раз при найме случайно нажимал на вырубание дерева,из за которого пропадал лагерь.
1.3.В предпоследнем прохождении,при приплытии на 5-ый остров хотел улучшить стенку за 3 монеты,случайно доплатил одну и за 4 монеты отправил рейд на ближайший портал..На этом моя династия закончилась,сделать я ничего с этим не мог,только сразу прожимать альт + ф4 после отправки рейда,что я не сделал.
- 2.Плохой ИИ.Рабочие - просто дегенераты,которые будут убегать ночью от постройки только завидев с очень близкой дистанции жадность,которая,очевидно,их догонит.Отозвать рабочих нельзя,взять на лошадь,как отшельников - тоже.А почему?
- 3.При развитии острова,когда есть хотя бы одна полная ферма - деньги скорее всего уже некуда девать,про наличие 2-3 ферм даже не стоит говорить.
- 4.Игра на самом деле очень очень лёгкая.Приезжаешь на остров - делаешь равнины для лучников - делаешь фермы и фермеров - строишь пекарню при помощи отшельника с третьего острова и стоишь до посинения нанимая лучников и желательно строишь стрелковые башни после стен.Любая волна,состоящая хоть из десятков родителей будет отбита.Желательно взять еще алтари с первых трех островов,или хотя бы с первого.


Игра в целом отличная,без особого гринда,с коопом,проходится на все ачивки и полностью за 50 часов спокойно.Разве хотелось бы функцию отмены действий и больше контента,чтоб было на что тратить монеты в условном эндгейме.",True,1634228143

"If this is your first Kingdom game I highly recommend getting this one. It looks, sounds and feels better than any other Kingdom plus it is a bit easier than New Lands.

For returning Kingdom players I would watch other reviews first. While the game is great I don't know if he expansions are enough to buy another Kingdom if you already have New Lands. It is worth to me because I really like the series. I can imagine that someone that is more a casual enjoyer might find this lacking.

I go a bit deeper in the video where I look at all Kingdoms so far but the most important point is that Kingdom has become very tedious. Ever since Classic Kingdom has become longer and longer without actually adding challenge to the whole thing.

It was until i bought the game for my girlfriend that I really wanted to see more content. I played this game all day with her, and we've completed almost every island and made use of every villager and mount. For this reason Im ecstatic to hear of Norse lands (the fact that only the host needs to own the dlc is AWESOME) and I would be ever more happy to see additional dlc or continuation of the franchise in coming years.

"If the nearly 150 hours in the game didn't speak for itself, I love this game. I love this series. It's minimalism done right. A lot of games try to do minimal mechanics and they just fail. This one is so successful, you're not going to miss using the rest of the buttons on your keyboard. It is a fresh take on what side scrolling games can be. The graphics are beautiful and the music is amazing. Although you're fighting enemies at night, most of the experience is very peaceful and relaxing. There is a lot added to this game compared to previous installments and they removed permadeath, which winds up being a huge plus. You learn the game by playing because there's no explanations for anything. Normally that would be terrible, but that's part of the charm of this game that I wish I could experience it again. There are several modes and challenge islands that keep the game interesting for a long time. This game is perfect if you want to really challenge yourself on the special islands, or if you want to relax and play slower on the normal islands. It is a little tower defense like too. Anyways, if you like base building, strategy, and a wide difficulty range, then give this a try.",True,1632415298
"It's pretty rare that I buy a game and genuinely want my money back but this game is 100% deep in that category.

So I read all these glowing reviews and was super excited at the concept and art I was ready to throw down and get deep into the game. 

So the positives the art style and design as well as the music is beautiful
....and that's it.

Straight out of the gate the negatives hit you square in the face, no text outside of the tutorial and no visual indicators to provide any sort of context as to what something is or what it does until you invest in it and EVEN THEN you may still have no clue as to what it does because the game gives you literally nothing. (case and point statues and the hermits)

No problem the tutorial will cover things right?!. Allow me to give you the brief run down of the tutorial of this game: Follow, Stand Here, Spend Money, [strike]Goodluck[/strike]. 
Absolutely stellar explanation there ghost friend, still no clue as to what the hell is going on and what benefit this rare resource you have me burning through is but ok.

So after this ""tutorial"" you are left to explore the barren context-less (but pretty?) wastelands devoid of text, audio or generally any context clues trying to figure out just what the hell is going on when you inevitably get struck down by the games main enemy. ([i]Thanks ghost friend you might want to include that in the basic lay of the land? a little warning perhaps?[/i])

So at this point you're thrust into the seat of a new voiceless, faceless horse commando and set back to your ramshackle town after figuring out, ""Hey, night bad?!"" and this is where the game truly starts to shine... by having the pacing of comatose sloth. 

The game then follows a cycle of run outside for a minute, quickly run back inside while your horse is dying because it hasn't been the gym in 140 years and then sit huddled in your base wandering around aimlessly until your archers kill the enemies so you can go wander aimlessly outside and try to get coins while still trying to figure out wth is going on?
And then you just do this loop ad nauseam until you repair a boat and then do THE EXACT SAME game-play loop on another island only slightly harder???

How is anyone finding this enjoyable? Like genuinely, I cannot grasp how this gameplay loop is somehow both [u]calming[/u] and [u]enjoyable[/u]?

"I love this game. It's calm fun and it has a creeping difficulty lets you explore and learn along the way can keeps you to pace with the enemies. Even though i do love this game there are some problems. The main problem that i came into contact with is the cloud sync feature. The Cloud Sync feature makes it so that if something happens to your local save you can download one off the cloud. The problem is that there may be a point where Cloud Sync conflict never stops uploading or downloading to or from the cloud and you can't access the game till this has passed. If you are adept at manipulating the files on your computer then you should be fine however even turning  off the cloud sync option through Steam doesn't stop this from happening. If this is a problem you think you know how to get around then you will love this game but if it isn't then you paid to have a unplayable game.

It's a good game to go in completely blind since you don't know what to expect with the Greed, looking into things is fine too but I think the shock factor made my personal playing experience a lot more fun, the trial and error element created for some good game play where you had to completely revise your strategy each time you reset your island. I will admit though, something that is frustrating is that when one side of your island is completely safe because you've destroyed all the portals, the archers and knights stay on that side. I wish it was possible to redirect them to the other side of the island, but its not enough to make me dislike the game. Overall, really good game.",True,1632060510

"Update Jan 2025:
I don't know what's going on... but this game's development continues to be really frustrating.
Between not documenting the changes they make to the game so you're surprised with lots of unexpected nerfs and regularly being told by their support that it's not a bug, it's just me being bad at the game... I'm not interested in supporting the game anymore.

The last 2.0 update completely broke the normal game modes, it took them two updates over two months to get around to fixing it.

The game is a great blend of chill and strategy, a lot of push your luck to try to get further, I enjoy it, but I guess I try to optimize too much and the game just can't handle that. Half the time I run into round ending bugs, the other half the time I hit bugs that cause severe setbacks. I always run into flaws in the game mechanics...

I guess it's really meant to be played as a chill game, even though they have difficulty options.

Dec 2023:
Nope, changed to a downvote... the bugs are too bad, and the game is missing basic features like the ability to remap keys.

They do release about once a year updates that usually fix a couple of the really bad things but cause a bunch of other problems. Often the balance changes end up causing as many problems as they fix.

The game is awesome, incredible theme, mechanics are fun. Simple but with a degree of intensity that keeps it fun for me. A little bit of random to help replaybility but also there's a challenge mode that is a little more random that's a little more playable.

They keep releasing big feature updates that often I think could be DLCs... so I guess that's commendable, but if money is the reason they don't get bugs fixed I'd rather buy a few $2 DLCs to help fund the fixing.

People repeatedly complain about the bugs on the forums, so they aren't that obscure. They're usually things that you can work around, but if you are trying to do something like a speed run, or a run on max difficulty, I get completely derailed about every other run by something that shouldn't happen.",False,1631741906

"After proceeding through the spartan-to-a-fault beginning, after 30 minutes, I thought: ""okay, time to uninstall, this is a mess."" Then I looked at a guide, which explained some of the things the game really ought to have explained to me, and then the game became surprisingly compelling. I recommend this - [b]with a guide[/b].

Let's get the bad parts out of the way, which mostly involve the game getting off to a really bad start:
- Game immediately launches to a (bypassable) ""please log in to your account"" screen.
- No key rebinding (come on, it's 2021).
- Lots of minor, non-game-breaking bugs (some required quit/relaunch when the game AI just 'stops working'). Ironically, ""tutorial ghost"" which tries to explain things to you was buggy to the point of never going away even after I had finished it.
- Game menus and options don't have tooltips or explain themselves. What's the difference between Multiplayer and Co-op? What island am I looking at? What's this left arrow button do? Who knows!
- Game doesn't explain.... anything.

""What does this building do?"" ""Who is that character?"" ""What does this irrevocable serious choice I'm about to make do?"" These can be fun questions for games that intend upon and support your death like this, where you have no idea what's going on and learn through trial, error, and dying. But this game has too little information about what is even going on when you're succeeding that you don't even know what's going on when you're failing (after completing the game I'm still not 100% sure what's lost vs. kept when you die). This is amended by simply reading a guide that has text which explains what each game object is. The game could use that for itself.

So what did I appreciate about this game? While simple to a fault, I loved how stripped down the game becomes by limiting my possible actions. If you played Majesty, you know the fun and frustration of [i]wanting[/i] something to happen but not being able to do it yourself, cheering your little minions on or tearing your hair out as they succeed or fail, respectively.

I like how the game withholds (certain) information for you, especially by not having a map. Many times while playing, I wished I had a map so I could see what was going on where, especially when a threat was inbound. But the terror and urgency and knowing something bad just happened without knowing where it happened, if you were successful or failed in repelling the threat, or if it's even still going on become a fun part of the loop. Sometimes, I would, after a long, long journey, eventually find myself back to the center of my kingdom, only to find the other half completely demolished. What happened? How did I miss this? Well, I just wasn't there.

When you get into the game, it has a satisfying flow. The core loop of trying to extend my kingdom, repel threats, make daring/risky movements (to positive or negative outcome), and eventually become so strong that I could utterly vanquish the foes was excellent and very addictive. Since you have no direct control over your units, it is a bit like rearranging furniture in an ant colony and watching it go. Of course, you're down there in it with everyone, and your life is at risk too, which adds to the excitement.

If you can forgive some rocky technical aspects and can handle reading a guide for how things work, there is a gratifying, addictive experience in here that makes a lot of game out of very few parts.",True,1630869176

"So, the basics: you are a monarch living in a side scrolling, randomly generated world (with different styles to choose from). Your roles are to recruit peasants and give them jobs such as to become an archer, a worker, and a farmer (and more to come later). Your enemy is The Greed. They are out to destroy your kingdom, and will appear every night. They will try to knock down your walls, steal your gold, steal your peasants' work gear, even your trust pet dog you get on another island! You are supposed to build walls to keep them out, and wait out their assault every night, mostly working in the day. Archers are your main defensive unit used to shoo down and kill the Greed, but there are others to help with that later. Beyond that... money (and the occasional gem) controls just about everything. 
I've only played the 2nd game (Kingdom New Lands) and this one (Two Crowns), and both games are very different in some very good ways. For instance, Two Crowns allows for multiplayer and allows for you to go back and forth between lands. In New Lands, your goal is basically to build up one land until you are strong enough to escape it, and I don't believe you ever return to the old one. Two Crowns also allows for you to eventually take a more offensive role in the game, whereas New Lands is much more defensive.
In New Lands, at the end of the core part of the game, a final island called Skull Island comes into play after the credits as a final challenge. In Two Crowns, you get Skull Island as a side game to play at anytime you want, along with other ones such as the new Trade Routes challenge. These are listed under Challenge Islands rather than Campaign.
Overall, this is a very unique and addictive strategy game franchise. I've introduced Two Crowns to a few friends of mine. They can play co-op mode either side-by-side with me on my keyboard, or online with only one of us owning the game.",True,1630640904

"[h1]Food for Thought Review[/h1]

I honestly enjoyed this game as you see my hours of playing it, I got addicted over the weekend for how simple yet fun this game can be. I honestly think all you need to start with this series is with Kingdom Two Crowns, the rest I feel is redundant and maybe even better for how they added to the game. Your whole objective is that you are a king/queen and you need to rebuild your kingdom and expand your land for power, while also kill your enemies the greed [spoiler]how original[/spoiler]. You as the ruler can’t really do much without your servants, after all no one rules alone. That’s why you got to fork over some cash and let your subjects do all the work for you! Yes, this is a 2D tower defense game where you have to manage both sides to beef up your walls so that at night the greed don’t show up and destroy your defense or steal your crown which is how you will get a game over if you lose your crown. 

This game perhaps at times for how simple it is can be boring especially in the beginning since you are just trying to earn some money to get more subjects from the hobo camp and recruit more farmers or archers. The soundtrack is so beautiful to listen, mixing the gorgeous background makes me sometimes forget how much time flies. You have your personal steed to ride around but of course you can always change it for a better one depends if you got cash or gems. Yes gems, basically like premium currency you have to find in chests throughout the land and you must keep it safe until you build a boat and the dock keeper spawns in so you can store your gems. Your citizens once you give them a role to do it they will automatically start working, is good but there is a double edge sword to it. You can’t change a class once you give them a role and you can’t command them to go which direction you wish for them to go. Which creates frustrating AI moments where I want to send all my units inside the cave only a few will go in with the bomb I made. If you accidently deforest all the trees where the hobo camp lives they are gone forever and you can’t bring them back, so the amount you have is all you have. Thankfully, your citizens don’t die but if you have a lot of farmers but little warriors you are so screwed.  Same if you want to do a perfect run of destroying the caves where they spawn the greed you [b]CAN’T GO BACK[/b] to the previous island you complete, because if you do you will have to restart your progress [b]again[/b] to that island! This has happened to a friend of mine I co-op with and it was such a rage moment for my friend. You must keep track of it otherwise you will have to do double the work. What exactly is the reward for completing all of the islands? Honestly, not much difference when they show you a stat of completion except it will role the credits that said you finally complete the entire game, very anti-climactic if you ask me.  

There are three modes but honestly they are just reskin with little difference in gameplay, the Shogun period is the only mode that is slightly more different than the kingdom or the “gothic” setting mode. Wish there was something a bit more. Either way I still got my money’s worth and despite sometimes how stubborn or stupid the AI can be, if you know how to plan it especially don’t destroy all of your hobo camps then it isn’t too bad to manage your kingdom. Also note, once you go to the next island that you have to manage, your previous island will still be attack from the greed and if you return back to your previous island then your defense might shrink for how much stronger the enemy have gotten each day, just FWI. Overall I would get it on sale and I call it a day. Thanks for reading!

The difficulty curb is also all over the places, maybe it's because the resources are random, and the dificulty of the game is almost completly tied to that. No resources, game is too hard, some resources and the game easy, too many resources the game becomes boring. 

Again, good game to kill a few hours (almost 12 for me), but once you crack it, it becomes annoying, not boring or too easy, just annoying to manage. Run from one corner to the other helping the archers run. There's no challege but the patience.",False,1629291711

"Having played over 200 hours of this, I’ll go ahead and say that: yes, this is a good game that I recommend.

Mind you, all other players’ complaints are valid and reflect my own, like: how come there’s no way to know how many farmers a farm can take? How come there’s STILL no way to remove a character’s tool so he can change classes, for example: to remove an idle farmer’s rake? And so on. I specially find the addition of the portal cave thing quite draggy and sometimes tedious, although it does add a sense of finality to each island.

Nevertheless, this is a simple yet amazing game with a superb soundtrack and absolutely beautiful art.

"I consider this a great improvement over the previous entries in this series. When I play those again, I find myself missing the new features in [i] Kingdom Two Crowns. [/i] For one thing, the gameplay mechanics are more ""efficient"", e.g. fresh recruits now run from their vagrant camps to your base. For another, there is more structure to the missions, in the sense that you feel like you're conquering and gaining new territory in a tangible, systematic way. This is true across a campaign, and also for a single island.

The ""Shogun"" and ""Dead Lands"" DLCs take it to another level altogether. And they're [b] completely free! [/b] ""Shogun"" is mostly a beautiful re-skin, with the main gameplay difference being the significantly denser forests -- with all that that entails. ""Dead Lands"" has more drastic changes: monarchs with powerful, supernatural powers can be unlocked, and the overall atmosphere of the lands within can be disorienting when you first play them. If that isn't value for money, I don't know what is.

It's worth mentioning the ""Challenge Islands"", self-contained scenarios with specific goals, meant for the veteran player thirsty for more. These keep you on your toes, but are really fun. At the time of writing this, four scenarios are playable, with slots for two that are in the works. I haven't tried local, split-screen co-op, so I can't comment on that feature.

In fact, the only thing I'd say falls a bit short is the soundtrack. I prefer the music in [i] Kingdom: New Lands. [/i] The extra tracks that come with ""Dead Lands"" are spooky in a good way, though.

ADDITIONAL TEXT ON 23-Nov-2023: Re-reading my review over two years later, I find no reason to change anything. The game has since received regular tweaks too many to mention, all making for a better experience. A new ""Challenge Islands"" scenario was added, called ""Lost Islands"". I have nominated this game for the Steam Awards 2023 in the ""Labor of Love"" category. Seeing how much I have enjoyed it, I very happy to have done so! Also, note that a DLC, ""Norse Lands"", was released for [i] Kingdom Two Crowns, [/i] but it is a separate purchase.

ADDITIONAL TEXT ON 28-Nov-2024: Here I am once again, due to the ""Labor of Love"" nomination for this year's Steam Awards! I do want that tick mark on that badge, ha ha! Seriously, though, it's a no-brainer for me. The ""Call of Olympus"" DLC was released in October. It's a paid add-on, and it's a decent and fun experience. The Greeks come with an interesting new-and-alternative method to assault greed portals, where you as the monarch lead your troops while carrying a banner. It's also possible to be accompanied in these assaults by warships firing ballista missiles at the enemy! It's a useful addition to your warfighting toolkit. Outside of the Greek faction, there are a raft of tweaks to the entire game. I actually played one of the older factions in a Challenge Island scenario, after buying ""Call of Olympus"" but before trying out the new campaign — to see what these tweaks were like.

When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

iN MY TOP 5 FAV GAMES,True,1625986386
"Overall, I really like the game. With any game, there are things I wish were different, and things I wish that were expanded on and given more depth or backstory for. But, again, as a whole the game is really fun. it's not ""high stakes"" or anything until you get to maybe the 4th or the 5th island, but even then, it's not bad at all. I recommend the game to my friends that like the kind of ""tycoon"" genre of games that this simulates (since it's like you're building your own kingdom). The dev's are active and receptive to feedback, and yeah.

Pros:
-Cute little pixel ""build to survive"" kind of game
-Easy mechanics and concepts to learn
-Cool mounts 
-The game is beautiful, and actually does a good job of setting in a bit of a creepy atmosphere if you go into the woods. Does a good job of making it feel like you've gone too far in at parts
-Unique and cool designs for the king/queen, and the greed that you face
-Really good diversity in the types of greed you face

Cons:
-With each island that you go to, the ability to get gold gets very hard, very fast. With little to no warning to it.
-That goes with getting more hobo's to pay to be a part of your kingdom as well
-The smaller mechanics of the game are not explained in the games pretty limited tutorial, for example the wandering merchant. Albeit he was explained in every guide I came across, it was a little disheartening to get rid of him on accident so many times and then realize it was easily avoidable.
-Combat with the greed, to destroy their portals and the cliff portals isn't explained very well. Maybe it was just me being dumb, but I had a bad and hard time trying to figure out how to get the bomb even as an option to use against the cliff portal to begin with",True,1625955568

"Interesting, sometimes compelling strategy game that I really wanted to like and even kinda enjoyed for a bit, but it's really let down by some specific frustrating design choices. I finally rage-quit because a wall-hopping mob snuck past 3 squads and multiple towers, outran me, knocked off my crown, then outran me again and took it, insta-killing my character after a 10 hour run. Too frustrating to build back from there.

Most of the frustration of this game stems from the lack of control that you have over your citizens. You spend a lot of time silently screaming at somebody to get out of danger or go somewhere else.

Why can't I cancel an order? Why can't I tell my workers to not go out and chop that tree during a blood moon? 

Why can't I tell my archers to leave a tower 2 miles from the border and do something useful? Why can't I tell my pikemen to guard a border wall instead of some random wall in the middle of my base? Why can't I tell my hunters to come home before sunset so they don't get caught defenseless? 

Why can't I choose to not pick up gold coins when my wallet is full? Why does removing a tree remove a vagrant camp? First time playing, I irreversibly lost the ability to recruit new villagers, soft-locking the run.

I understand that part of the appeal is supposed to be learning by doing and trying again on the next playthrough, Rogue Legacy style. This game is far too slow and plodding for that. This game would strongly benefit from being much more transparent with its mechanics and offering the most rudimentary level of control over your citizens.",False,1625720125

Every now and again on the new islands you can get a new ""game changer"" which really just boils down to; slight buffs for townsfolk, almost useful mounts, and or special townsfolk who actually bring something interesting to the table. For the most part you'll just find yourself waiting for the next new thing to spice up the game for a couple minutes then right back to the grind.

"I would really like this game, but its lack of crontrol and missing information to the player, i cannot.

It is beautiful. It is atmospheric. At the beginning it is fun. But if you dive deeper a lot of basic features you would expect are missing.

Missing Information: 
- How much coins do i have? Is my coin bag full? Sometimes some more that the maximum fit it, sometimes not. When do coins fall in the water when on the ground?
- How many famers fit into a farm? 3? 4? 5? I dont know. 
- How many vacant peasents or farmers do i have? I have to ride from left to right the whole time and count them.
- What do shrines do? I activate them, they lit up and by looking at it i see a scythe, so something with the famers? No clue.
- What are the abilitys of the mount? Some ride faster in wood some on grass. How much stamina has the horses compared? You have to alt tab out of the game..
- What do the hermits excatly do? Guess i just dont use them then.
- What are the stats on the map when choosing the island?

So much questions. A little bit of exploring and figuring out what stuff does is interesting and fun. But not giving any information slowly adds more and more confusion and less and less fun. What am im doing here.. please give me feedback if what im doing is efficient and towards my goal.

Lack of control:
- There are 3 upgraded towers on one side, so in total 9 archers in them. Can you please leave your tower and defend the wall? No? Ok. Stay there and let the defenses fall. Best strategy is not to build towers inside a wall. Or maybe give me the ability to deconstruct them and also get some money back as my kingdom expands.
- Knights attack! Okay we destroyed on portal great, onward! Wait stop, why are you going back! Oh no they are really going all the way back and i have to send them all they way again..
- Okay we destroyed all enemy spawn structure on one side. Everybody come and please defend the other side! Nope. You are now just useless and defending nothing.
- Oh shit i have too many builders and i need more archers. To change that you need to: get overrun and loose the game and next try choose different. Fun!

"I played this when it first came out and was happy to buy it again. It's a beautiful game; my roommate and wife both commented on its aesthetic when they wandered in while I was playing. The learning and difficulty curves are fairly gentle, though I did have to look a few things up that aren't self-evident -- the different mounts' pros and cons, what the different hermits do, what to do during winter with the bushes, etc. Controls are as simple as can be. Oh -- the music is gorgeous and adds so much to the overall bearing that I can't imagine the game without it. 

CONS: I wish there was a way to organize information a bit more; I'd like to see how many of each subject I have, for example, so that I don't waste coins. Traveling from one side of an island to another is also a chore sometimes in the early game, as is traveling back to earlier islands. 

It's not a perfect game, but it is a fun, beautiful game that's provided me a lot of needed diversion.",True,1623342665

"I love it because is chill and little challenge game. I don't have friends who want to play but it's fun in solo mode. There are bugs that have not been fixed since the game was released, one of them is with the workers. There are trees that you need to remove paying a single coin if you want to expand your territory to kill the enemy's spawn, When you miss a tree and don't remove it, you have the opportunity to remove the next one in front of it, when you do it the workers remove the next trees and you make a bare place with a tree in the center. Then you can't expand your territory, even if you mark the tree to be cut down, just the workers stop doing what you told them to do (I have screenshot with this bug in my profile). :(

"I'm normally not really into strategy games - normally it seems like there's often a few too many rules, statistics, and other intricacies to learn up front for me. These games seem like they can be a lot of fun, but this barrier for entry often has me trying them out for half an hour before getting overwhelmed and pushing them away into the dark corners of my backlog. However, Kingdom Two Crowns happens to have been a type of strategy game that clicked with me.

I got this game as a part of Humble Choice, after having gotten an older version of the game (Kingdom Classic) for free a while back. Kingdom Classic I never took the time to try out, but I decided to give this iteration a go, not really knowing much about the game going into it. As described on the store page, Kingdom Two Crowns is a ""micro strategy game with a minimalist feel.""  There's a lot less you have to manage and worry about in this game. Most actions in the game are done by spending coins - all structures take coins, people can be recruited using coins and then later be bought tools using coins. There's another currency called gems, but these are fairly rare and mostly used in buying special upgrades you might find while exploring. 

Apart from these currencies, the main other resource you have to worry about is your people, which are recruited and then take on jobs based on the singular tool they hold. Fairly straightforward in game. Each job is fairly self explanatory as well. For instance, if someone has a hammer they are a builder, which can then work on structures you want to build. Or, if someone has a bow they are an archer, which will defend your walls at night and go out hunting during the day, killing rabbits and deer that drop coins on death (of course). As you go through the game certain professions might interact with new types of units and buildings in new ways, but usually the game is setup to teach these mechanics in a self explanatory way.

On a similar note, this game is fairly forgiving overall. If you strategize poorly in some strategy games you might ultimately lose a game that you may have spent hours on. And while I can see the appeal of wanting to master a game and beat it, this possibility is fairly discouraging to me, especially considering the time investment in some cases. In Kingdom Two Crowns failure is usually just a setback. You might have to rebuild walls that Greed (monsters that attack your kingdom) attack or buy new tools if they get stolen by Greed. The main failure state is if the Greed manage to attack you and steal your crown. If this happens, the reign of your current monarch is over, and you will then get the chance to play as your successor who now has control over your (slightly decayed) kingdom, still with much of your progress in tact. There is an achievement for beating the entire game with one monarch, which seems like a good challenge for those who might prefer more challenge. 

Of course, every game has some drawbacks. Repetition is one issue I kind of had with the game, especially in the late game. In the main campaign there's five islands to explore and eliminate the Greed from - each of which you need to build a kingdom on separately. There's some different upgrades to find on the different islands while exploring, and the Greed get more aggressive on later islands, but the basic kingdom building process is mostly the same. On the second and fourth islands you unlock new tiers of ""technology"" that you can then use throughout all your kingdoms, which I did find were a good change of pace. But by the end of the game, the process of finally clearing each of the islands seemed to drag on for a while. Another issue I had was that there were a few mechanics in the game that weren't really obvious. The main thing that stands out is that vagrant camps (where you recruit new people to your kingdom from) are destroyed permanently when you cut down the tree on either side of them. The main indication of this in game is if you happen to notice a camp go away after sending some builders to cut down some trees (which you might not stand around to watch), so I only found this out after reading a guide. 

Overall however, I'd recommend this game. I only played the default campaign mode, but from my understanding there are also challenge modes with special islands to conquer, and alternate versions of the main campaigns (Shogun and Dead Lands) that introduce some changes.",True,1622062539

"Absolute fire game. I read all of the bad reviews and the majority of them were pretty misleading. Any major bugs have been fixed, or I haven't run into any that effected game play in a major way. The art style is fantastic and cute, and there is plenty of content beyond what I thought would be there. It is no wonder the game has so many good reviews. Worth full price, which is what I paid for it, plus it comes with TWO FREE DLC's that I have yet to even touch to be fair, but the stand alone game is worth it and has kept me occupied thus far. It is 1 gig big and just about any computer can run it.

The game is a little rogue-like and does not hold your hand through the overwhelming amount of awesome content you will run into, but the game design is simplistic and easy to understand. The Co-op is very well done, and the AI is somewhat intuitive. Progression is addictive and every new piece of content you discover is magical. The game is also beautiful between the music and art style.

The strategy is allocating money/gems that you gather from forest encounters to kingdom investments into troops, economy, upgrades, and defense.  There are other components to the game but you essentially develop enough so that you have the infrastructure maintain you kingdoms and expand from island to island and unlock new things. The waves that attack you at night only get harder, and as you progress you start gain the ability to strike back. 

There are some things in the game that people criticism, such as order mechanics, RNG map spawn, and other elements regarding hermits and kingdom expansion.

Honestly, this could be an amazing game, but there are two major problems:

2. Lack of control. Accidentally upgrade your wall when night is approaching? Well, be prepared to have a wave of enemies destroy you since you can't cancel an action. Or how about the inability to control where your troops station? I need archers on the left side, but they are all stacking on the right, and I can't do anything about it since they refuse to move.

Also, there are some glaring bugs here and there.

"Kingdom Two Crowns is a two dimensional side scrolling sort of tower defense game in which you are the king or queen. To this end, your main method of influence is choosing where to spend coins, which then influences which units are trained and which buildings are constructed. Beyond some light exploration, the entire goal of the game is to survive the waves of monsters each night and to conquer more territory each day. Despite its charm, the game often wastes the player's time through the use of obtuse systems, slow movement, and an overall lack of control. To this end, I would advise against purchasing this game as it’s not worth the time.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]

Through your crown, you have the right to rule. More specifically, you get to pick where the money goes, and as such, what gets done in your kingdom. For that matter, the locations of buildings are predetermined, having foundations that you can invest in to construct specific buildings. For instance, a small stream can be converted into a farmhouse, and larger stones into guard towers. While you aren’t able to get money yourself, your citizens will go about their tasks each day, some of which being profitable. For instance, hunters can generate coins by hunting wildlife, and farmers can work the land to generate a steady income each day. One incredibly nice part of how this all works is that all the coins generated will eventually find their way to you, as most citizens will rush to pick up coins, and throw them to you when you’re nearby. With that in mind, you can focus on the tasks you can do without needing to worry too much over collecting all the coins. All in all, this part of the game is quite good. There’s a steady sense of progression, all strengthened by fantastic visuals and animations. Unfortunately, the good more or less ends here.

There are five islands, each a little larger than the last. While the monarchs are mounted, their steeds can only sprint for so long before they tire and need to walk for a time. What I cannot emphasize enough is that the islands are [i]large[/i]. It takes roughly one day/night cycle to cross the livable section of the first island, and twice that to traverse the equivalent area on the fourth island. This is not because there are meaningful structures dotted across the area, but rather that the important buildings are spaced minutes apart. Want more builders or archers? Take a minute long journey to go spend money at the fort in the center, and then take another minute to get back. Need to access the farms to fund developments on the western front? You’ll need to make several trips due to the limited wallet size, and it could take several minutes each time if the only safe farms are on the eastern side. What’s worse is that none of the unlockable mounts directly solve this problem. While some are faster, many are the same speed or slower than the default horse. Beyond directly wasting your time, the large map size negatively impacts your workers as well. To this end, some spearmen and hunters will wander from one end of the kingdom to the other during the day, far enough that they’re too far to make it back to their posts come night time. With the map being large enough, it can occasionally take several minutes for structures to be built and retrofitted depending on where the builders are wandering as well. Ultimately, the overwhelming majority of your time will be spent walking from place to place, wishing your steed could sprint indefinitely.

The monsters are generally referred to as “Greed”, as their main goal is to nab as many valuable items as they can. For this reason, groups of them attack your walls each night, retreating when the sun rises. This would be concerning if they weren’t so easily dispatched. While the first night is sometimes a trial, setting up new walls and guard towers while low on manpower, subsequent nights are trivial, leaving you much more time to complain about the travel time. However, there will occasionally be a blood moon (or blood day) during which there will be substantially more enemies that arrive. More importantly, these events might summon enemies that are more threatening than the basic ones: large golems that spawn small enemies, and flying enemies that can ignore fortifications. While the basic enemies are practically harmless, these variants can tear down your fortifications in a single night and, if you’re too slow, end your game while they’re at it. The primary issue is that there’s no good way to stop them. Archers get kidnapped from their guard towers, and a kingdom’s complete army gathered over the course of an hour proved insufficient to fell more than just one or two of the golems. For this matter, there is no strategy to the defense. Either your front line has rocks on which to build towers, or it doesn’t. The walls could be right next to each other to allow for a hasty retreat when the first is breached, or they could be a minute apart. Further, the only way to possibly improve the defense further beyond adding more archers would be to build ballista towers, which require rocks and a specific npc which can be permanently lost if the walls are breached. In the off chance that the walls are breached, all you can do is hope the sun comes up to drive off the enemies before all is lost. With this in mind, the defense is ultimately beyond your control, and arbitrarily hands you a fail state when you get overwhelmed.

There is a very minimal tutorial, and some important mechanics that are never properly explained. For that matter, where do your citizens come from? The game teaches you that you can promote homeless people to citizens by tossing them a coin. From there, you’ll quickly find that these guys spawn in camps towards the edges of the map, roughly one or two a day. What the game does not tell you is that cutting down a tree directly next to the camp will cause it to despawn, leading to scenarios where it’s impossible to get more manpower on a given island. Further, removing the camps means minutes more of walking to collect on the one or two people per day. What’s worse than a shortage of manpower, however, is a shortage of coins. Without funds, you can’t conscript the homeless population, direct construction, or assign jobs. You can’t even detonate the twenty coin bomb you bought without extra coins (still salty about that one). Anyhow, the seasons change as the days pass, and will eventually hit winter when you’re an hour or two in. During wintertime, almost all the available sources of income dry up. The rabbits stop spawning, farms wither and die, and fish can no longer be caught in the water. This leaves you to manually cut down trees, which will get you one coin profit each if you’re lucky. The only other way to get money is to send your farmers out to berry bushes that spawn outside your walls. If the map is large enough, the walk will be too long, and your very expensive farmers may not be able to reach the berries during the work day. To summarize, the game more or less stops during the wintertime by taking away your only channel of action in the game, and lasts for over an hour. Last but not least are the gemstones used to acquire permanent upgrades. These can be found while exploring new islands, and are limited in quantity. Along with some of the upgrades they can purchase, they can be permanently lost if captured by the Greed, cutting your options later in the game due to one or two mistakes.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]

Kingdom Two Crowns is a Skinner Box at best, giving you that little bit of reward just often enough to keep you interested, but overall fails to give meaningful choices to the player. Instead it pads itself out with lengthy travel times and obtuse mechanics, while limiting the player’s control on any given aspect. While the visuals are fantastic, they do not solve the core issues. In my opinion, the game is not worth the time, even with a second player.",False,1621041624

It has such satisfying animations and sound effects, like walking by a farm and picking up a whole sackful of gold feels awesome. But then you might have to wait for a builder to build some wall before nightfall and a wave of greed either ransacks your archers, or forces you to dump all that precious gold in payment. The bad moments feel so devastating, while the good moments feel triumphant, which is great and really immerses you in the game. The various art styles, which differ between the game modes, are creative and unique. Playing each mode doesn't feel repetitive, they all feel like their own worlds. It's a great game to play with a friend, and actually becomes much easier than playing solo.

I would recommend looking up a short guide because the game's tutorial doesn't fully cover everything and it's a bit complex at times.

I'm stuck on the first island and get to just sit there while my AI do nothing and get murdered. I'd love to go to the next island and try to get some upgrades to maybe survive a bit better, but with the infinite sailing bug, I can't. So I get to sit there with wood structures that after a couple weeks in game will just get destroyed since I only have archers, farmers and workers (cuz again... can't progress) 

I'm also gold capped, so I have gold just sitting on the ground or falling into the ocean. And I can't spend that gold because why? The game is bugged and I can't move to a new island to get more upgrades. Even trying to just play on the first island, you can only get so far before the wood defenses just aren't enough, or the base is so big you can't get any of your AI to reliably expand. And no amount of archers with worse aim than a Stormtrooper will help. Try to build a tower to defend the area? Nope, the workers decided to all stand on the complete other side of the world, so by the time they get there, it's night and they get destroyed. If I could actually assign workers to posts, the entire game would play infinitely better, but based on the AI and three button control scheme, it must have been too hard to program.

So... good attempt. It seems you missed the mark, though.",False,1620631961
"It's so simple but so compelling. It's just hard enough to be a challenge but not so easy that you get bored. 20 hours in and it doesn't feel like I've played it that much. 

My only complaint is I wish it had a clock feature, it's hard to see when it's daylight/nighttime in certain areas. That's probably a feature, but sometimes it's so gloomy it looks like night the entire time, it's not really enhancing the game.",True,1620613640

"If I was forced to pick only one game to play for the rest of my life, this is the game I would choose. 
It is such a beautiful game. The pacing of the game is flawless, the beginning is easy and the game slowly gets more challenging, forcing you to focus on where you will invest your few coins before the harsh winter hits. Then the brutal winter comes, making progression challenging if you did not properly prepare, but that is the fun part. You have to be very careful with your coins, it'll feel like you have a lot then BOOM... winter hits and you're broke. Planning when to build and what to build is very important. 
Pro Tip: do not build high level walls if the sun is over halfway across the sky...
The music is spectacular. It always plays at the perfect times as well. Not only is the music amazing but all of the sound effects are incredible. The arrows shooting, the coins dropping, investing in a building or tool, and the greed melting all sound perfect. A lot of games don't have really good sound effects the way this game has. 
The picture is incredible as well, it is such a pretty game. The trees and sunsets, the characters, the water, the clouds and the background are all so beautiful. You can tell the developers of the game are incredibly talented. You can tell they really care about and love this game.
If I had to say one bad thing about the game, I would say that the dog is too cute and I always get very attached to it. It is very sad watching the greed take your dog, do not let it happen.
Overall, Id give this game a 10/10. I think this game is perfect, and there's a lot they could add to it as well in the future to make it even better.
To the devs; I don't know if you read or can even see these but I just wanted to say thank you for making such a beautiful game. Everyone who worked on this did a spectacular job.",True,1620538342

i do think this game is better if you go in unspoiled, but just one tip for brand new players that i wish i knew, BUILD A FARM

if you see a water stream in an open area, pump as many coins into it as possible, its how you get most of your money. i didnt know how to make a farm, and i wasted a good 40 minutes of real life time making 0 money and making 0 progress

if you need to make money to get your farm up, you can herd deers to your archers if you wiggle next to them in a certain way, this is also something i learned in my 40 minutes of wasted time

"After playing for a few evenings (2 pers.) The end was near. We had 2 more islands where we each had to destroy the cave and a number of portals at the other island. So we started with the portals and succeeded, when starting up island 3 (last island) it was already weird. The island was completely reset and all portals were there again. After a number of errors and with difficulty bringing the game back to the point of attack, things went completely wrong. My friend attacked and at that moment I was also throwing my coins outside the walls (farms yields enough). During this moment, something goes wrong in the game that we have experienced before: The game drops out and takes on a life of its own. When restarting the game we only get to see No crown no Queen .... Game over.

The last **** attack and the game fails due to defects for the creator? So I don't recommend the game! To avoid frustration for some people.

from everything i could find out this game has been a broken mess for years, so i have no hopes of it reaching a playable state soon.

"What a frustrating game. All you can do is pay money for things. Which is fine, but nothing ever seems to happen. Ive got tons of money but no people to hire with it. The only way you can hire more is by exploring, but as soon as you do you get mobbed by invincible monsters that steal your cash. All you can do is freeze them or pay them to go away. Any peasants you manage to recruit will be killed far faster than you can find replacements. Walls do nothing, archers do nothing, if you ever buy more than one tool at a time the game seems to prioritize farmer over anything else even though you may need something different. You have no control over this at all. If you try to only buy tools when you need them your wallet is incredibly small and can only hold a limited amount of gold. Meaning any extra is just lost. Meaning you are incentivized to buy tools you dont need just to preserve your wealth. But then the game takes over on prioritizing actions and it does a terrible job.

"Kingdom Two Crowns is a terrific game that I always find myself coming back to. If you're familiar with the Kingdom franchise, then know that this is definitely the penultimate Kingdom experience thus far. Though a common complaint is that the game has not fundamentally changed enough to merit sequel titles, I argue that the vast amount of additions and improvements more than justify the existence of 'Two Crowns.' 

The art and sound design for Kingdom Two Crowns is impeccable! From the serene sounds of nature during the day to the creepiness of the baddies skulking about at night-time, the musical effects of the game do a wonderful job of immersing you in the game world. The developers work wonders with the pixel art and even the smallest of in-game assets look incredible. 

Base-building during the day is chill yet tactical. It's important to plan ahead when deciding where to build structures since you can't deconstruct anything once it's been built. In-turn, the nightly raids by the grotesque creatures of the night will work your nerves as you hope that you've funded enough soldiers and have strengthened your walls enough to withstand the onslaught until morning. 

Kingdom Two Crowns brings tons of improvements upon earlier Kingdom titles that all serve to increase the value of the game. I appreciate that I am no longer restricted to just a 'European kingdom aesthetic' and can now delve into a 'Samurai' and 'Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night' themes (granted, I don't understand the need for a Bloodstained crossover and generally dislike that franchise'). The dev team has teased further theme choices for Kingdom Two Crowns and I'm very much looking forward to what we'll see next. 

A minor gripe is that the game does not always explain all of its various mechanics. However, online wiki's do a great job of filling in any gaps. 

All-in-all, Kingdom Two Crowns is an absolute banger and I'd recommend it to casual and hardcore gamers alike. I find the $20 USD price point to be steep but the game is a great value when on sale.",True,1619912181

"Man is it hard to judge this. I had 20 hours of good fun, but then 30 minutes total of such heart wrenching disappointment when all my patient hard work is rewarded by a death by no fault of my own - just archers sitting around not hunting for no reason, making me run out of money, or the controls suddenly not responding while I'm running from the Greed...

This game is way too grind'y and slow to afford disappointments this huge, and apparently I have to start a 10h world all over, no ""go back to island start"", no manual savegames, nothing...

I was so hoping for more story, more adventure... A faster g*dd*mn mount... Because man it takes AGES to run across the island, it gets kinda boring. But it wasn't given - through no fault of my own, hours upon hours of world building was shattered before my eyes by a game breaking bug.

If the game would be a bit less buggy, and offered some options to make it faster-paced (either through settings or through in-game events), it would be a 9/10 easy. But the way it is now, it managed to turn 20 hours of fun into a time waste. Such a shame. 4/10.

/edit: So, I came back to it. It's just too addictive. I don't know if I did something wrong the first time or if they fixed it (could be both) but in the end, I had to change my review to thumbs up, as I can hardly justify a thumbs down if I got a few more dozens of hours of fun out of this.

The thing is, it's extremely frustrating and lever difficulty is terribly luck-bound. You may start a chapter and find the only usable resources to be incredibly far away, maybe behind enemy gates. Or just a quick walk away from the castle. The sages may be kidnapped and remain as such forever while still walking to reach your new kingdom. When you start a game, no idea where your castle's ground is. Nothing is ever explained in the game - you constantly need to consult online wikis. Sometimes you are trying to give money to wannabe servants, but you end up asking to chop the tree which dismantles the refugees camp - no undoing. You can't restart a level too without letting yourself get killed. Otherwise you can only restart the whole game. I hate losing at a game and persist trying to finish it at all costs.

"Shockingly and immediately BAD. 

I was really looking forward to this game as it's highly rated and an indie success. 
Right away, it's off to a slow start, not giving any direction to what the goal is or how to play the game. Just move left and right, or tap twice to run. Picking up and spending coins is all you can do - that's it. The game for as far as I played it was literally riding a horse back and forth and picking up and dropping coins. On top of that boringness you can't control your AI teammates which is like... mind-boggling. I told myself I'd give it an hour, but I couldn't even make it that far. 

Anyone reading this who wants a much more satisfying base building/defend against the horde/gather resources/recruit and give jobs to your colony, I highly recommend Grim Nights, which is only $3, 15% of the cost of this game.

"Got as a bundle on sale.... Holy crap is this game addictive. I had to restart my save a handful of times near the beginning as I realized I was totally screwing myself over, but after a couple attempts I finally started figuring out the mechanics (which is an awesome feeling when you accidentally stumble upon a game mechanic that would have helped you hours ago 🤣, and also when you figure out something you HAVE been doing that was very very dumb....). If there are instructions, I haven't found them yet, and for some reason I love that. 

The one thing that I wish I could do, is undo a tree cut down request when I accidentally select one I didn't want removed (or any request for that matter). There might be a way to do this... haha but if there is I haven't figured it out yet. There have been a couple times when I've accidentally ordered something to be done, and watched in slow, agonizing horror as my little workers started a chain reaction leading to the demise of my kingdom (or the collapse of a lot of progress at least) - It is kind of a fun aspect of the game though...

Overall though, I LOVE THIS GAME and the sick, cruel, beautiful trial and error that it forces upon you with devastating consequences. I haven't reached the end of the game yet, but *I think* I'm close.

"Sat down to play this for a few minutes, got sucked in for 6 hours. But not because it's an amazing game that I couldn't walk away from. I had no idea wtf was happening and I refused to quit out of sheer stubbornness. No story whatsoever. You're trying to build a kingdom on a side scrolling map, then you build a boat to go to another island to do it again. Why do you keep building kingdoms? Who knows. It doesn't matter. It's a game with no depth. You are trying to defend yourself from enemies and close the portals that spawns them, but the game gives zero direction on how to do this. It's trial and error. Oddly, you will get a tutorial ghost show up at random times and harass you to ""follow"", usually when you are in the middle of something and don't need the interference. You are at the mercy of a really dumb AI, hoping that your workers go where you want them to go, defend what you want them to defend, kill what you want them to kill. Spoiler alert: they won't. You will arrive at certain structures that you need gems to build, and apparently the structures are required to progress. You can't earn gems, you just have to find them. The game provides no insight into what the structures do, so you take a gamble with your irreplaceable gems, only to find out you gave away your gems to get a different mount, and now you don't have enough to build a mine or a quarry or something needed to move forward in the game. It's a terribly designed game, complimented with pixel art that manages to be neither retro nor charming, but feels incredibly amateurish and lazy. For 6 hours of play, I got my money's worth since it came out of a humble bundle, but I don't think I'm revisiting this one again.",False,1619299607

THEY TOOK MY FUCKEN DOG. THIS IS WAR,True,1619278804
"It saddens me deeply to give a negative review to a Kingdom game. I had anticipated its release and had quite some fun with Two Crowns, having played it with my wife, but as of now I do not approve of the direction the game is taking.
The devs seem to have forgotten that the beautiful, unique and enjoyable masterpiece of a game that initially gave them success, critical acclaim and fans' love has always been Kingdom and not Dead Lands or any other layers of cr4p they may add to it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating it just because it's not the cup of tea to my personal taste, it's just that the classic outlay of the game (as well as the Japanese one, which I actually enjoyed as well) doesn't get the much needed support, love, patching and further development it deserves. I don't mind Dead Lands at all, just don't give it the priority!

Yes, my discontent rises mostly from the ""Trade Routes"" update, which was the last straw. I kept my attitude cool and tolerant up until when I learned that the Trade Routes, the new coop challenge mode, works only with Dead Lands, meaning that it's behind a ""no, thanks, not gonna play that crap"" bar to me.
[spoiler]Dear devs, you might as well just give it Steam Workshop mod support and you'll have tons of anime bs girls and whatnot, if that's what you want to see in your game.[/spoiler] 

TL;DR: Can't really recommend this, unless with a decent discount and a person to play it with, due to multiple bugs and, despite relatively frequent updates, some sort of abandonment of the true Kingdom spirit. If you enjoyed classic Kingdom, you'd be better off playing New Lands instead of Two Crowns.",False,1619267023

I know Im a useless character in terms of combat, but cmon...  Im a king/queen.  So I should have the followers listen to my command.  

that stinks...

It aint fair, I tell you what.  Will this bit change?  Probably not

It isnt gonna be great to play for the first time.  Mistakes are permanent.   I looked around,  Towers are a must but they say but they are not.  Once they are there, and an archer occupies it, thats it.  You got a useless archer once you've expanded your kingdom.

"8/10 Interesting strategy game. Relies a lot on managing coins and time. One wrong planned raid can lead to your town being destroyed the following night. Has a range of different mounts to ride. I personally like the deer early game and the Lizard late game. In Dead Lands you can also find different monarchs to switch to, making the game have enough variety when needed. 

Game is straight forward, build a civilisation, every night monsters attack. Defend and conquer. But how you go about building, attacking, defending is up to you. 
Playing Co-op is also fun but is not necessary if you want to play solo. 

The one downside I have the terrible coin bug. There is a bug where the people will not pick up coins and they fall into the water, meaning you can not grow your population. So far the only way to fix it is to log offline for a few hours and trying loading back in.   Even then sometimes uninstalling and reinstalling fixes the bug sometimes.",True,1618439930

Gems (second currency) takes up coin space, making the previous point even more frustrating. To gain Gryphon, you need to return an island you started at, as there are no gems on the first island (or I was too unlucky).

In my most recent game, I made it to the fourth island despite the many glitches. Suddenly, the game decided to make everything impossible. My farming building just completely vanished and wouldn't come back (no matter how far I expanded), there were four blood moons with only one night in-between each, my archers refused to hunt, and my pikemen threw their weapons down instantly and ran out into the hoard with my builders for no reason. On top of that, some of my villagers would pick up gold and then not give it to me and the castle upgrades kept taking my gold and then not doing anything. Finally, my monarch's ability kept disappearing and I could only get it to work again my going in and out of my map.

This game NEEDS one of those things: better AI or a management system where you can destroy, cancel or just disable buildings.
I have been force to restart my game just because trees too far away are marked as trees to be cut down and ALL my builders start a suicide mission.
If you want to do a challenging game you need to make the survival thing less easy, you cant just expect the player to play without errors and not giving them tools to get up from those errors. I will play this game again when things as simple as recruit a person in a campsite becomes the destruction of it due to the bad interface management, or a miss placement of a structure force me to start a new game from scrach.

"I think it is one of the best strategy games ever made. Simple, fun and unique. But it could use some more explanation about playing... I have given a negative review at first for this game because I believed it is unbeatable because of the growing enemy waves. But I was wrong.. After I didn't press alt + F4 for a rage quit.. realized that the progress is saved on the islands, so don't have to start it all over after died on 30+ day.. The game needs more then one run to make completed.. That is OK.. but no one told about it.. First I played only Kingdom, which had only one level to beat.. wanted to compare this to it, but it is different.

+2 for the style and the idea, these are the games I like the most. Unique idea. :)
+1 for visuals, sounds, music. Pixel graphics are perfect for this game.
+1 for variety of mounts, it is really exciting to try out more and more mounts because they are all different.

-2 for lack of explanation about the playing. Too many things needs to be experimented
-1 can't control units and that is causing many trouble
-1 the speed of actions seems too slow compared to the time of the day/night period.. in day time it is hard to do more than one thing effectively.
-1 I had some serious problems on winter, when farms couldnt produce and berry bushes were too close to enemy portals.. literally starved to death..

"Kingdom Two Crowns is a 2D retro pixel city builder/time management/tower defense hybrid... wait a minute.  I've written this review twice already.

A couple of things have been changed but not nearly enough to warrant a ludicrous $20 USD price tag, more than AAA games where the developers had enough budget to get someone who knew how to do 3D graphics.   Especially considering they made Kingdom: Classic completely free.  That's definitely a gamer friendly move, but it's also devastating to a business plan that involves re-releasing the same game every year or so with a different title and a couple of skins/palette swaps.

Currently, at the humble Monthly bundle: Kingdom Two Crowns is a minimalistic town builder, using a cartoonish art style similar to their predecessor Kingdom: New Lands and fully 2D side scrolling.


[h1]Gameplay / Story[/h1]


Hello Princess, take your crown, build your empire and kill the greed!


You start in an empty world, a beautiful forest, and you have to build up an 2D empire, to your left there is death and to your right even more.
Kingdom two crowns is a beautiful game, its artwork is outstanding colorful and due to the color you feel sad once it vanishes in the dark when the greed comes. This game is minimalistic, I mean really minimalistic. You need either Gold, a renewable resource created by almost everything and Gems, something you have to watch out for. In this game all you do is expand to the left and the right until you can't go further and need to find a new island to expand and get the necessary resources and there comes one of the biggest issues I faced with this game, not telling you anything. The games hold your hand with a minimalistic attempt to help you, saw what I did there? You have up to 3 camps where every 24 in game hours 2 people will spawn, and you can recruit for a gold piece. Did you know that they will disappear once you chopped down the surrounding trees? The camp to live needs at least one tree left or right. This would be nice to know before I have chopped things down and can't get more people on this island now. I can mind read your comment "" But Ajay! This is game! It's meant to be played this way!""  Look, adventure is one thing but learning by doing mistakes only works when the mistake will not kill you permanently. Just think about how children learn heat is hot! They put their hands in the fire for a brief moment or on the stove and once the injury is cured you now know not to touch hot things. Your parents are not watching you burn alive or tell you to touch the stove until your hand is gone because you deserve it, the normal one would not, but this game does. When the flying enemies came in and started to kidnap half of my army without any possibility to get them back, yes that was a nice day. It is bad game design when you have to check other pages to understand the core mechanics of this game. And you know what is the counter to this hobo abusive tentacle monsters? Give it a guess! Its more archers than they can abduct. It is no fancy, buy super towers or get yourself some Wasabi Ninjas or tentacle slicing pike men. Its just get more and you are safe. This is a super lazy design choice. Besides of this I still like the game. It gets me every time when the Griffin falls and hurts my heart I can't help him immediately.


[h1]Pro[/h1]

+ a lot of different Enemies
+ Unique hero with 3 different game plays
+ building things is fun
+ only 2 resources to gather
+ art work is beautiful and colorful
+ you have to fight on 5 unique islands to get the greed killed


[h1]Contra[/h1]

- Own AI is clumsy at best
- Boss Enemies can be unfair and create such an impact that you can start the game from scratch again.
- explains nothing which causes game fails and restarting from scratch


[h1]Conclusion/ Who will enjoy the game?[/h1]

Kingdom Two Crowns offers an addictive game with unique units and a beautiful setting. You can choose between the European medieval world or the Shogun world (with fishing wasabi ninjas) and it's great, I had to work around this game and read a lot of wiki pages to understand the game mechanics once that was done it was a fun game with a lot of work to do and a lot of managing even with this minimalistic gameplay.

So who will enjoy this game? Do you like Minimalistic building games with beautiful artwork and 2D setting like Terraria and Starbound? Do you also love to have no clue what to do, and you will either fail a lot or need wikis to get your game mechanics explained? Then this game is for you!

"TLDR: It's a good game but the multiplayer is horribly buggy and they put their own concerns about MP above your own needs.

For those new to the series: It's a great game, it can be rough but it's not hard once you learn the ropes. It's fun, and atmospheric.

For those coming from the other two games: This game is very different from classic and newlands. Same looks and overall stratagies, but key differences to how winter works as well as death, change how the game is played significanly. I do recommend if you're looking for something fresh.

For those who want to pick one of the three games, classic - newlands - or two crowns: Two crowns is on a nother level, and i don't rec picking just one - because they play so differently that means you'll get a significantly different experience between newlands and two crowns. so - i'd say start with newlands, then get this after you beat it.

Now for the criticism: The multiplayer is bad. Really bad. It took us two hours to get the game to actually connect to each other, it repeatedly said ""failed to connect"". We aren't computer or multiplayer noobs: this failure to connect is not a fault of our doing. We still don't know why it even worked in the end, but we're dreading our next session because we might have to do the same song and dance again.

the good news is, once we did get it working, we had no issues with the MP, the bad news is the game has bugs that can only be fixed by shutting the game down and booting it back up.

what's scary though, is my computer does NOT get blue screens of death, but after installing and running this game, it did. Not only that, but for some reason, after the restart, it had to be reinstalled. steam didn't detect it, but after starting the install it did find the files that were still there and avoided re-downloading everything. Still, this, along with the MP issues, is not a sign of quality work.

Last complaint: These devs are NOT consumer friendly. There is no reason this game couldn't allow a direct connection between two gamers without needing steam. Just like how java addition minecraft doesn't need internet for two people to play with each other, the forced steam servers is exactly that - forced. I suspect they were putting piracy concerns over the need of a customer just wanting to play with their brother in the same house with no internet issues. in short, they punished legit customers for their own greed. heh. To add more proof to my argument, the devs do not allow random people to join. you have to friend these people first - which means what exactly are the steam servers needed for? it's certainly not for match making. The more I look at this, the more I'm convinced they did it out of greed.

in short, it's a good game on the single player aspect, but you might not be able to connect to your friends if you all buy the game and try to play with each other because they decided force a middle man for your connection and the devs probably lack experience in this field.

final problem about this is when steam breaks, or dies - MP will be impossible on this game if they aren't in the same room.

About steam link/play with friends via a video stream: it worked, but my friend said steam made the image look blurry af. even to people in the same house as me, the image was blurry. So I don't really recommend ""stream play"" for visual games like this.",True,1616848673

If you are going to get one of the Kingdom games then get Kingdom new lands (or the first game Kingdom) which is a brilliant strategy game and highly highly addictive. It also has a really nice pixelated  graphics and lovely soundtrack. I cannot not though unfortunately recommend KIngdom two crowns as the game has been dumbed down so much that it is a borderline clicker game - the challenge has been lost from the first two games which were both brilliant. I suspect that when they ported the game to touchscreen tablets some people complained it was too difficult hence the dumbing down.

Vast improvements since the first one (no longer have to rely on banker's interest for winter living)
You can very easily do local co op all by yourself since the game literally only uses 4 buttons per player

**Just accidentally found out theres now FIVE buttons to use due to the new dead lands dlc (campaign specific?)

Why would you ""local co-op"" by yourself? double the players, double the inventory, double the easiness of the game.

NO
I had to actually look up what the darn controls are, after ~10-20 hours in, i didnt know some mounts had special abilities!

Once again, game heavily emphasizes that every decision made is a final one.  Forces you to learn potential campaign game ending lessons if you can't figure out some game mechanics properly, thus forcing you to restart the entire campaign.

A such lesson is if youre in the middle of the end game area, you are hard locked to either beat it or die. You need as much money as you can get. Otherwise you're just stuck in there to die (probably) but luckily i have been turning co-op mode on and off whenever, and the 2nd character had enough money to do the objective.

Japanese DLC is 90% reskin with 10% new content, seemingly harder and easier at the same time.
Japanese DLC unit, ninja\ronin is a lot more useful for fighting, but 99% of the time never FISHES. In comparison to its pikeman original.

When you go on the offensive, the troops are 99% useless when they run back home after an attack, so if theyre caught running back home in the middle of an enemy attack. they'll usually get picked off with them not even fighting back

Knights now have an upgradable weapon, do not use it. Their archers stop shooting when their knights are prancing around like deer.


^^ NO, HOTKEY, SETTINGS. SEE ABOVE ^^

Your offensive units positioning can get themselves killed when attacking sometimes, not sure if its a bug. 

Your money system is random, its not a set 'i can carry up to 40 coins' its a 'hopefully i can carry up to 35-40 coins'  since coins picked up randomly fall into your inventory. and balance up on top of each other sometimes. otherwise they fall out of your inventory, 1\2 will fall permanently, 1\2 will fall to be picked up again.

If you dont have enough money when purchasing things. they don't return back to you. (they fall down, you pick them back up) BUT they spread apart and will sometimes fall out permanently (into the water off the maps edge for example)

Challenge mode is a pain in the butt, tried it for the first time, didnt know objective other than the ones stated before launching it 'live for XX days, defeat XX things'  but it definitely does not tell\show you the GAME ENDING HIDDEN OBJECTIVE, because hey! why should you be a homesteader when YOU NEED TO EXPLORE ALL THE TIME.

"Is difficult to me to leave a bad review here, also considering I've played the Kingdom Saga from its debut as a browser game, but there are too many elements here that are really mining my ingame experience pushing me to leave and stop playing this game . I will explain why I think this game is actually not as good as it could seems, is a bit long so take your time and read it before you buy !
Kingdom and Kingdom New Lands were good games, I personally prefer Classic, but New Lands introduced many improvements and expanded the original experience in so many ways that you should actually play it before playing this title !
I want to repeat myself again telling how I really loved and enjoyed the previous games of the series, and, yes, I really wanted to leave a good review here like I did for what I think has been an innovative but simple game, full of good vibes!
This chapter has been developed not by the original creator of the saga, but by new developement teams, in fact Noio, founded by Thomas Van den Berg father of the original Kingdom, and Licorice that join the develcopment in the following Kingdom: New Land, have been replaced by  Stumpy🐙Squid, Fury Studios and Coatsink.
This is one explanation on why the game is very different from his predecessors in every aspect, a difference that does not reside only in its new skins and scenarios, as a matter of fact while you’ll make further in the game you’ll be able to see the changes made by the new developing teams starting from the new Campaing mode to what seemed to me like a confused mix of new interesting mechanics but not improved at all but throwed in your face, something that in a certain sense also betray the original soul of the game !

So let's start with the CONS:
This game present itself with the same problems contained into the previous titles of the saga but amplified: 
broken achievements appearing randomly on your steam without meeting the requirements to obtain them, achievements that if you are lucky will appear randomly, if you 're not... forget about them, but while in the previous title it was a matter of one of them here the entire system of achievements is completely fucked up ! 
How written above, the game itself present with serious changes like a campaign now, you will travel again like New Lands through various islands and you'll have to move between them, go to the next one to obtain technological upgrades, like rock fortifications, with the possibility to return back to the previously visited locations to re-obtain gold, improve them or to obtain the upgrades that you need for your units and only unlockable using  ""gems"", the new value introduced here, needed to turn on the Sanctuaries for upgrading your units and to obtians unic improvements and mounts. That would be interesting sure, something new, but the problem is that the tutorial does not explain it ! They used the same tutorial, literally they copy and paste it from Kingdom New Lands but withouth taking the disturb in making a new one dedicated to this game, in particular considering that it is COMPELTELY DIFFERENT THAN ITS PREDECESSORS !!!! To me It seemed and felt like the developers where  extremely lazy, but hungry for profits and easy money using the fan-base of the Saga and its name to make easy profit, and it logically make a sense if you want to see it like that. considering that they have made few changes discarding the richiest things on where the old team concentrate itself  and transforming the game in something other. The result :  a game that feel like an Empty bottle of good seasoned Scotch. They removed many techinal improvements deleted the good elements of the previous games  like the de-facto ""minions intelligence"", the AI optimized by Noio and Licorice, that the original developers continously improved here, HAS, BEEN, BROKEN ! 
A simple and exaustive example: if you expand your walls or build mills your bowsmen and farmers will not move to defend the fortifications or doing their work, they will not move or moving withouth logic, like for example going out of the walls at night not because you laaunch a build action or order them to cut trees, they will just randomly move withouth logic and moving when they must not endagering and mining your efforts ! This is an extremely frustrating bug that stressed me the most and that ruins the originally smooth gameplay bombing his relaxing pixel atmosphere and filling it with anger! 

PROS.
The graphic is similar to the original relaxing pixel jewel that was Kingdom, but while originally the center of game, imagined by Noio, was “Nature” itself, with a rich and fully animated environment where you realized Nature itself was the owner of the Kindom and you the guest, here is different, one of the achievements is to cut every tree on anisland, it probably a fun joke from the developers because they where exausted to place all the trees they put inb game but that achievement I think betray the spul of the game and the meaning of the so improving natural environment wanted by Noio, expanded in their post apocaliptic Gardening game named CLOUD GARDEN, that you will surely appreciate if you enjoyed this aspect of the old Kingdom development !! 
By the way I don't know if thie new graphic in here is a pros, they actually cutted the old models for new ones, probably because the originals were owned by the previous development team, thing that fill the experience with poorness, to move around scenarios with different skins but completely empty and withouth a soul …. 
The other innovation are the new scenarios,  themed one on Bloodstained and the other one on Feudal Japan. These scenarios does not introduce great innovations if not just aesthethically, the skins changes like the architecture but nothing more, few changes does not optimize the unbalanced experience here, but it can be funny to try and see the different skins on our units by choosing different Realms/scenarios, Knights for example becomes samurai, lancers becomes ninja, is funny and I think this is a good aspect, also considering these dlc's where actually free and automatically added to your Steam library ! 

Sadly the new entries does not fill the emptiness of the whole game that actually feels like a different game,  this should in fact not be named Kingdom, it has a completely different meaning and soul, so different form the one implanted in it by its former father and creator Thomas van den Berg. 
So what happened to the game ? an explanation can be found on the official site of the game :
""Raw Fury acquired the Kingdom IP from the original creator Thomas van den Berg in May 2019, as he decided to pursue new projects. Gordon Van Dyke, co-founder of Raw Fury, has been involved with the Kingdom series since the start, was crowned as monarch of the entire series after the acquisition.""

If you want to understand what I am talking about here I encourage you to buy  the previous titles and enjoy what has been a masterpiece until today, ruined by what seems a simple ""push to buy fro the title"", where the title promise something that cannot give to you … Ironically it seems the Greeds have at last conquered the crown...",False,1616503732
yes,True,1616479822
"The games ok. Though after playing it for 8 hours I never felt like I accomplished anything despite progressing four islands and completely clearing out the first island.

The main reason I can't recommend is the AI is frustrating and totally outside of your control. Many days go by in the game where you can't make any money because the hunters refuse to hunt. And if you have no coin then you're stuck waiting and watching as your hunters do nothing.

Another big gripe is the way you recruit people. After the trees around the recruitment camps are removed, you can no longer spawn get people from the camp. Leaving you in a very possible situation where your island can spawn no more people and your stuck with that you can bring over on boat.

It does have coop but I found it to be even more annoying where when the AI doesn't know what to do and one person gets stuck doing nothing. And because each person essentially gets half the island, you can't run to the other side in hope that some hunter somewhere is doing something.

Shame, I really wanted to like this.",False,1616469081
good and cool,True,1616353101
"Playing this game in co-op is more enjoyable for me, and the new mounts, monarchs, attacking the mountain, berries, crown snatchers, etc. are a welcome addition. However it remains quite repetitive and there are issues that haven't been solved since the first game and which make the game frustrating and unnecessarily challenging. Some examples: if an archer gets snached from a tower, another archer will try to take his place... even if it's in the middle of an attack and it means running head first into the enemies And then another one will try, and so on. This is a reaaally easy way to lose a bunch of archers for no reason. Same happens with builders: if you asked to have something built but your builders are coming from far away, they'll still go out if the night has fallen and get immediately killed. Not being able to cancel a contruction is really frustrating when you build a wall by mistake... and it's almost nightime, and all of your catapult, knights, etc. move behind this crappy wall and get immediately killed. 
Now, these are annoying game mechanics that could have been done on purpose to make the game more challenging. What are not on purpose are the constant glitches: sometimes the nightime would deactivate and I wouldn't realize the night was falling until getting attacked; other times the pikemen or archers would stop hunting, and I couldn't make money; the monarchs would glitch and their powers (freezing, fire, etc.) would stop working... in the middle of an attack. Often these glitches would be solved by rebooting the game, but sometimes the game had already saved after some glitchy catastrophy, and in any case having to reboot the game 3-4 times per session is very annoying.
I'll recommend this game on a sale because I still had fun with it, but the bugs and glitches make it so annoying that I rage quit very often.",False,1616346557

It is a bit tough to get into it I feel, because there is close to no tutorial but honestly you learn enough by doing. All in all it's very relaxing and each time you ""die"" (read: lose your crown) you basically restart with ""remnants"" of the ruler you played before. So it allows you to catch back up fairly quickly.

"It's a deeper / more complex take on the original Kingdom game. Still has the same ""difficulty through obscurity"" thing going, which I'm not sold on. It was cool when I was a kid and every game had a different control scheme and rules and the Internet wasn't a thing so I had to learn by trial and error - now I don't have that patience anymore. The main problem with it is that, once you read a guide and play a bit, it's actually a pretty straight forward strategy game - that doesn't make for a lot of replayability. You can only learn how to play the game once, so making that a central part of the experience in today's world looks like a very strange decision to me. But ok.

Rant aside, the game is beautiful and has a solid gameplay loop that will keep you engaged with that ""just one more turn"" feel. But it's definitely more on the casual side of the spectrum, it's just complex enough to be engaging.",True,1615987841

"This game is currently in the Humble Bundle for March 2021. If you are interested in the game and it's before April 6th, 2021, consider picking up the game as part of the current monthly bundle.

After an playing an hour to review for the Humble Choice March 2021 Bundle:

This is what appears to be a minimalist town builder.  You play a queen who is running her Kingdom and recruits peasants, She can instruct her citizens into a few roles by paying for their gear.  

This is a hard game to understand, as there’s a bare minimum of a tutorial, and after that new players might not understand exactly what they’re doing, but after an hour I was able to build a ship and move on to the second island. 

I’m not 100 percent sure if I beat the first island though or solved some puzzle, there’s not a very strong feedback loop but it’s usually clear when you’re making some progress or at least gaining some wealth. 

I would recommend this game if you like what you’re seeing or want to puzzle out some of these elements.  I even used a bit of a guide and even there, I’m not sure I fully understand the flow of the game… After the hour I don’t know if I like this game, but I also don’t hate it. It’s not a problem with the playtime, it’s a game I’m completely ambivalent about, but I will return to play a little more either way.

The first game was worse, here at least you have some different scenery, which is nice. (It looks very pretty.) I didn't touch the tougher islands much. I talk about the campaign.
I dislike if I have to google answers for a simple game like this. However: I made a nice kingdom on the first island but apparently I didn't know, I have to unlock the stone on the second island. (searched)
And there, good luck for you! First you don't have enough people. After I finally found some gems, got an antler and that was a great upgrade! I even unlocked the stone! I suffered back myself just in time to the first island (the creatures nearly took my crown on the second) and I used my last gem to unlock something new, which was a new mount, but since it was worse I wanted to switch back to my antler but somehow I couldn't.
This game is just stressy, plus goes on the ""remember - replay"" line while you run left and right, and if you make a mistake, just restart the whole thing, you will die anyway. I don't play games to feel pressured. I'm sure in coop it would be better though, but in solo, personally I pass.

"Yes. I definitely recommend this game.

While the subtitle is Two Crowns and has co-op, I've only played solo and it's pretty good.
This game is noticeably easier than the previous game New Lands. Personally I like that, but there's people who lament it. I can understand their disappointment, even though this title is more my speed. MOST of the time it feels like if I lose I messed up, but there's been quite a few instances I was frustrated with how some mechanics work.

A cool thing about K2C is that are 3 different themes. There's the standard medieval theme, the weeb Shogun theme (Asian/Japanese), and the Dead Lands theme which is a crossover with Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (a game I highly recommend.). There's a Norse version coming soon, it's not out yet at the time of writing this.
The main theme and the shogun theme are very similar. To my memory the only mechanical difference is instead of pikemen you recruit ninjas... which IMO aren't as good and aren't worth recruiting. But theme skin is cool.

Dead Lands, on the other hand, changes up quite a bit. Instead of being a generic monarch there are 4 specific ones each with their own special ability. The one you start with whips and causes a freezing wave a short distance in front of her which stops enemies from moving or attacking for a few seconds allowing you to run away, or your archers to thin their numbers. There's one that projects another you a short distance in front of you so when you use your mounts ability (more on that later) it's doubled separated just a little bit. Another turns you into a swarm of bats which allows you to travel extremely quickly. The last... I forget. I think he does something to your subjects. I never use him so I'm not sure. Most of the buildings are the same as DL, but there's an extra one that's like a giant stained glass you can to pay a couple coins to change characters. It cycles through the ones you're not using and you put in the coins on the one you want to be. It can occasionally change at the last millisecond leaving you as a character you don't want to be.

In the vanilla and shogun themes IIRC there's just 2 mounts with special abilities. The gryphon which can flap its wings and buffet foes backwards, and the lizard/salamander which breathes a gout of fire that persists on the ground for a few seconds and sets enemies on fire. Dead Lands has these, the others reskinned, and more. One creates a small plant barrier that can take a couple hits. Great to position yourself just behind your walls then use it just outside it between it and the enemies. Only 2 of them can exist at once. (4 if you use the twinning monarch)

Like I said there are annoyances, though thankfully one of them is being fixed in the next patch. Which leaves the fact your engineers will stand around a million miles outside your base with not doing anything and simply can't make it back and outrun the greed (the enemy) while trying. Arg.
But overall this is an enjoyable experience for me, most of the time pretty chillax even though I know everything I'm doing is to prevent hordes of foes from breaking my walls down stealing all my subjects tools, and taking my crown.
If this looks like something you'd be interested in definitely check out some videos and consider getting it",True,1614155829
"Before I begin, this game was at the gray area for me for a while but after reading developers’ comments about the developing process and DLCs, I decided to make this review positive. This game adds bombs to destroy mountain portals, mines, some mounts a couple changes in mechanics, some new units and upgrades but most importantly co-op. However, these additions to New Lands aren’t enough for someone who has played the other Kingdom games and co-op isn’t challenging or a different kind of approach. For these reasons, developers added two free DLCs. One of them is a Japanese texture pack which changes pikeman to ninjas (only different mechanic), other one has new mounts and riders who can cast a spell other than the texture pack. Even with these DLCs, game doesn’t feel so different from New Lands. Since it is not expensive and offers co-op you may want to try it.",True,1614121480

googling i find out that the answer is ""no"", ""no"" and ""no"", which means:

it's very easy to get into hard fail states where the only answer is to restart the entire game and erase all progression and slowly work your way back again

this WOULD be acceptable if the game respected the player's time at all, by e.g.: a global game speed setting or time skip button to more quickly move from decision point to decision point, as decision points are few and far between in the game, with the void inbetween them filled by mandatory waiting, or travel that is 100% without any risk or danger

but combining high risk, a need to start from zero, and a huge mandatory time investment, is a mistake. remove either of those and it becomes perfectly fine

the game design here apes arcade machine aesthetics, without understanding that certain restrictions in those weren't done to challenge the player, but to get them spending dollars at a predictable rate, which ... isn't the case for a game you buy once

instead of challenging your intellect purely, the game forces you to pay with massive amounts of time, something that is also shown by even the fastest speed run being nearly 3 hours with copious amounts of risk-free travelling, and lots of waiting around

"I enjoyed the previous two Kingdom titles, but this one is my favourite by far.  It is a simple 2D city-builder with tower defence elements.  While there are a couple of frustrating aspects, for me these include the lack of control over placement of walls and towers (they only go where they can go; your options are build, or don't build).  The other frustration relates to unclear mechanics.  Nowhere does it tell you that seasons are 16 days long, and the visual differences between spring, summer and autumn are not enough to help me track when winter, with all its brutality, will come.  But aside from those things, the game is strangely compelling, and I absolutely will keep playing until I complete the game with a single monarch!",True,1612163817

"I've played the Kingdom Classic, and Kingdom New Lands. Kingdom Two Crowns is by far my favorite version. 

Kingdom puts you in the role of a monarch who can only interact with the use of coins and building up a kingdom from a little camp. Your goal is to explore, defend and build until you beat the game. 

This game is unique in the sense I've not come across any other game like it where it's nothing but atmosphere and very simple controls to use. Every decision you make has an effect and is lasting. What you build is final, there's  no undo. When you explore it's a risk the deeper you go. What you unlock means you unlock one less thing you encounter. 

While this game is a good experience solo, the addition of multiplayer and coop between 2 players makes it shine above the rest.  Being able to easily have someone join you in your journey and pass the time is great and gotten many people to partake even those not into games.

If you're looking for a game with a great deal of depth, deep micromanagement and strategy that has unparalleled replay-ability I would look else where.

But if you're looking for one of the best pixel art games, an atmospheric experience you can share with someone that is simple, engaging and gives you an accomplishment of building up something from nothing, I highly recommend it. The game has improved with every update, and continues to get updates, and is one my all time favorites.",True,1611801639

Only downside would be that game has its end, and that only enemies we have are those called Greed. Would be much better with more options and if the game had more directions, perhaps more different themes, buildings and stuff like that.

"Despite many design flaws (result of ""coin only"" control approach and limited agents' AI), this game has dense, captivating atmosphere, and dangerous addictive charm. Once it starts growing on you, it never stops and you will keep returning. The funny thing that although the game is supposed to be about monarchs, kingdoms and feudalism (the name, the crown theme, the fantasy setting and costumes), you are actually a fantasy capitalist - you don't rule by commanding, but by investments - give a beggar a coin, and he will become your loyal subject. Buy him a bow, and he will become hunter and ranger of your ""kingdom"". Equip his squire or knight, and he will rank up from an irregular to an uniformed foot archer, with more discipline and ability to fight in formation. Other followers can be turned into farmers, builders, lookouts, pikemen, and more. 

But one thing remains the same - you never command directly, just toss a coin here and there, and watch your frugal minions start running. On the income sight harvested grain, speared fish, shot deer and rabbits are turned into coins to fill your ever-hungry royal purse. 

In the day, you build and toil and prepare. In the night, the creepy, mysterious ""Greed"" comes from portals and caves to steal your coins, tools, pets, friends, and ultimately, your crown. No crown - no kingdom, so that is something you have to guard with everything you have. The small greed just runs and steals, but some can fly and others can level your buildings with massive, boulder-like fists. 

Every now and then, ominous music and red moon announces a special, big wave of greed - those times you will really hold on for your dear life. Speaking of music - the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, and the game could not achieve what it does without it. Moody, dynamic tracks perfectly underscore what's going on in the game, be it a lyrical, melancholic misty morning, tension filled dusk filled with the crimson moonlight and fear, or the despair of your few survivors who keep abandoning wall after wall, as the hulking monstrosities get closer, hoping for morning sunlight to bring salvation. 

Overall, the game is far from perfect, but across the many numerous version (let's be frank - you bought the same game over... three times?), it has been polished into what can be called a masterpiece. Extremely good game, worthy of any gamer's attention. And hey - it even features a split screen coop!

"First of all, the online co-op is incredibly buggy to the point that sometimes when an ally joins your game, they literally cannot move until you restart the lobby. Additionally, messages that are supposed to be showed to all players after a particular event occurs, sometimes only shows to one player, including instances where even the player who triggered the event to show the message doesn't get to see it. Lastly, in the tutorial, sometimes one of the players can go out of bounds to an area that they shouldn't be able to access until the tutorial is completed.

Second, there is literally no challenge factor to the base game. Whenever you, or you and your allies if you are playing co-op, lose the crown, you get sent back to the first island and keep all upgrades that you may have had, as well as getting a fair sum of coins. This makes for extremely monotonous and repetitive gameplay where you just make either excruciatingly slow progress over time, or you manage to expand quickly, but are still forced to do much of the same set-up on every single island. Getting reset to the first island, rather than having to reset everything, gets rid of most of the potential strategies that you can devise a plan to incorporate, because regardless of what you do, you are still going to be making progress.

I bought this game because I figured that the core mechanics were similar to Kingdom: Classic, but multiplayer. However, this turned out not to be the case. As I have limited time to play with my friends, I certainly would not want to waste that time playing a game such as this one.",False,1611001728

"This game is almost fun, generally. There are things to do and discover. It's alright. It's slow but has a certain charm. 

One thing kills it and I recommend against playing for this reason: Winter. There is no excuse for how Winter works in this game. In winter you basically just watch the game masturbate until spring comes. It sucks. They expect you just sit around and ride slow (no grass for the horse) for like, hell, an hour? More? F Winter and F the developers who thought this was ""fun.""

EDIT: As you can see, I played it a while longer after writing the above review. I think I'm done with it, although I haven't quite beaten it. Some more points to consider:

1 - The game is SLOW. It's slowness hides the lack of content and the shallow gameplay. There are plenty of times I wished I had a 2x fast forward button somewhere because there is a LOT of waiting.

2 - Once you get the basic gameplay down, there's very little the game adds as you go. There's no choice between types of towers to handle various kinds of enemies, for example. You find camps, you recruit hobos, you make archers, you expand your borders. Once you get far enough you make some knights and attack portals. But that's it. Once you get it down, you have hours of repetition left with no surprises until you beat the game.

3 - As the game goes on, half of the difficulty increase is actually just hassle and annoyance, since there's still really no new strategy to learn. In other words, they put things farther apart so it takes longer to do the things you did 5x before. This is a real PITA by the time you get to the 5th island, which is where I gave up. My hobo camp was so far away from the main base that dudes walking back would get eaten before they got to camp so I could use them. And I've already 'beaten' the previous 4 islands--there's nothing new to do here. It's just the same stuff again, but it's going to take way, way, longer.

4 - For the amount of time they think you'll be playing this game, the soundtrack and pixel art both fail to impress. Like, for real, you're going to be spending 90% of your time just standing there waiting for crops to grow or night to come or whatever else. There's nothing in the art that justifies that kind of wait and the soundtrack is honestly pretty boring.

Which was super awesome because your idiot archers were out shooting rabbits.  So they jut get slaughtered, leaving your walls defenseless.  I tried for three nights to overcome it, but it's impossible.  Giving up, going to a different game.  It was a good three years of christmas-period gaming on this title, but I'm done.

"The gameplay loop can be repetitive, and it's definitely not the kind of game for everyone.

But what it IS, is shallow looking but surprisingly deep strategy game of determining how and were to deploy buildings and walls to maximize your resources and protect your kingdom. Building placements are permanent and positioning needs to be considered. The islands resources. build points, and placements are randomly generated, with limitations, making good and bad configurations possible.

The medieval and shogun modes are almost the same with minor differences, but mostly aesthetic. I personally greatly enjoy the Dead Lands expansion which introduces characters, abilities, and mount redesigns/replacements from Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, alongside a world with the aesthetic of the same. The mounts and monarch abilities add a nice spin on the strategy-Miriam's Ice Whip can temporarly freeze the Greed, for instance-and the Bloodstained aesthetic is just nice.

I think it's a pretty good upgrade from the past iterations. Different enough to make it worth getting, and the multiplayer can be good fun.",True,1610824878

Truly an absolute time waster, but in a positive sense.

So far, however, I've only been in the multiplayer mode, which is captivating enough and was simply missing, especially in the first titles. In pairs you can now expand your small kingdom to up to 5 islands and fill your sack of gold.

But anyone who thinks that the game is easy for two is far from it.
Decisions must be well thought out and a small misstep, whether it's expanding the wall just before nightfall or a spontaneous attack on one of the many portals, can have fatal consequences.

"This will be an essential copy of both of my reviews regarding New Lands and Classic, as this is again more or less just an expansion of both, but in short Kingdom: Two Crowns is once again a further improvement upon Classic & New Lands in terms of the addition of co-op, 3 themes with some unique elements in each, and general improvements all around.

Even without a friend, I highly recommend trying this game out if you've played either of the prior two, or do have someone to join you on your journey, as it will certainly give you at least a handful of hours worth of playtime when it comes to exploring, and trying not to completely lose every kingdom you create.

The overall gameplay loop is not that difficult nor expansive after playing for enough time, but the main gameplay and enjoyment comes from arguably trying to defend your settlement for as long as possible, while also planning ahead as to what you need to do next without over expanding and risking your citizens lives.
However, in Two Crowns, like with New Lands, you're allowed to sail to one of five islands, all of which will retain your buildings (for an amount of time), while trying to obtain the upgrades each offers, which you'll have to return to your previous settlements to further upgrade upon once they're unlocked. 
The latest expansion however in terms of Dead Lands does offer the new unique ability to swap between one of four new characters, each having their own unique ability, which can help to slow down the Greed, or give you a beneficial movement option. 

You can unlock some new things overtime such as a faster/different mount, or hermits which will upgrade or give bonuses to specific buildings, but the only real global unlocks would be in regards to buffs to your citizens, and the increase of material strength as you advance out to the other islands. However, most of the gameplay just comes down to strategy, and expanding and upgrading your settlement as much as possible before all hell breaks loose during the major ""raids"" every few in-game days when the blood moon rises.

In terms of music, the soundtrack is completely new from Classic & New Lands (from what I can find) having its own unique 14 tracks to hear.

The only real negative I can see is that It can be frustrating at times if you accidentally place a work order, and one of your citizens goes to do it when you don't want them to, but that's apart of some of the skill needed to know when to do things without risking a possible loss. Otherwise, there isn't too much that hurts the game.

Overall, I highly suggest trying Kingdom: Two Crowns if you've never played it or the previous games before, especially when it's on sale. You certainly won't regret it if it interests you.",True,1609646938

Summary:
Kingdom Two Crowns is a video game which you must play if you love self-loathing. Build up your kingdom piece by piece for hours only to be punished by making the smallest mistake as your archers fire at the clouds while being savagely mauled by the shadow demons standing right in front of them. Watch as the horde breaks into your base and methodically dissects everything you have worked so hard to achieve. Meanwhile, on your other island bases, you have been gone for 47 days and the dark portals now spawn hundreds of armored monsters ready to free your butthole of its earthly chains.

Detailed explanation:
As my first time playing this kind of game, I can say that it felt a bit weird only being able to move left and right and spend gold. I got over the idea that you cannot attack or fight or do anything else and that it is the intended mechanic of the game. It vaguely reminds me of the game Majesty wherein you pay gold to motivate your heroes to do or hunt something. Except, in Majesty the AI is very bad. In this game, it's just okay.

The archers get taken out in one hit and have about a 15% accuracy when firing on a nearly static target. So, the only strategy is just to mass archers. It takes a long amount of playing to get a squire or whatever but they seem to take damage every time they deal damage and are assured to die after a few hits. After building a giant army of archers the only thing they will do is hunt rabbits or defend your base. In order to progress in the game you have to defeat the portals spawning bad guys. Well how are you supposed to do that when the entire squad gets completely wrecked? The portal at the dock has a tentacle arm, the AI made all the archers walk right up to it and the entire squad of them died in one hit to the tentacle arm. So you have to retrain them and then wait for another leader to be made to lead the squad again. This is out of the players control, why do they need to stand directly on top of the portal to where the tentacle arm is just deleting them from existence in one shot? The only viable way to defeat the portal is to send two squads at the same time and spam coins and if you do that whole process twice you might win.

Now, the game doesn't really explain any mechanics but I have found it is unclear when a squire will ""appear"" after paying for the shield at the castle (go from a shield to a flag) meaning that the squad is ready. I have found that because I built so many towers and the archers are so effective at killing the enemies, the squad never forms because I think one of the archers has to get a certain number of kills to become the leader. But you cannot delete structures or cancel commands so if a portal is left up but the monsters cannot get to your free standing archers, then you can never form a squad and thus never order that squad to attack and thus never be able to complete the game.

Another comment about not being able to delete structures or cancel commands. The vagrant camps or trading/merchant outpost must have a tree on either side of it or it will despawn. Well, if you are two hours in and you accidentally delete that tree and there was only one vagrant camp then sorry buddy you just have to restart your game because there's no way to get more units.

Winter is a joke there is nothing to do but sit there and wait it out unless you have painstakingly planned for it and turtle on a safe island where you stockpiled tons of gold but otherwise is completely unplayable and not enjoyable. 

The AI does many stupid things, deers run the wrong direction, workers run out into danger and die to the monsters, solo archers or archers in a squad run instead of fighting thus showing their backs to the enemy for a free tagging (yep shove that tentacle arm in there real good), when you need builders they all bunch up on one side of the map to complete a tiny project, builders prioritize a bit unpredictably and those that man the catapult become inert potatoes, giving gold to a vagrant far away results in him slowly walking for sometimes an entire day or more to the center of the base to pick up a tool or weapon - I have even found them just wandering about when there are 4 hammers ready to go waiting to be taken.

The balance of gold in the game is absolutely disastrous, you're either starving for it and collecting 1 piece every 2 days or overflowing with gold and it's all spilling into the water and being wasted. The banking system is unclear and there is no way to modify or improve the size of your coin purse. There's no storage chest for that matter?

Sailing makes you crash your boat every time. A mechanic of the game. ok. It doesn't make much sense why they would ram their boat into rocks every time but sure. I understand about locking the progress to the next island and although it adds a challenge factor to the game the whole time I am not able to enjoy it (aka it is not fun) for two reasons:
1. I am worrying about my first island that i just spent at least 30-45 minutes on (or an hour more realistically)
2. why would you take away an upgrade in a game? the feeling of going backwards is horribly grating. Do we keep forgetting how to sail every time? Do you drive your car into your garage at full speed everytime you come home and have to repair it? I know I do.

Running takes too long:  the fast travel options are too late into the experience.  The AI isn't autonomous enough to support this.

Well, you can blame me for not ""getting good"" enough at this game if you are critical of my opinions but at least don't overlook the possibility that there are design flaws in a visually and aurally pleasing game. It is a shame. Aesthetically, it is a mismatch - the music and graphics make you feel relaxed but you can't relax when playing the game. 

Half-hearted suggestions:
1. Give the player instructions: optional tooltips, explanation of mechanics. The minimalist style of ""not saying anything so the player can figure it out because it's the style of the game and it's imitating old retro games"" is not doing anyone any favors here.
2. The boat doesn't crash.
3. Archer accuracy improved at least by 25%
4. Give the horse unlimited stamina - it's just annoying, the attention to realism is appreciated artistically but just not enjoyable when you need to get across the screen and spend an entire day running.
5. Let there be a messenger bird or some mechanic to check on your other islands in some capacity.
6. allow swordsmen sooner, this is a medieval game aesthetically but no one attacks with blades? you have got to be kidding me. How is that so rare? The King doesn't even have a sword? Why don't the vagrants just rob him then?
7. Remove winter or create something for the player to do like mining or smithing.
8. Fix the AI or let the player set AI priorities.

I think this game just has lots of balancing issues and conflicts with it's aesthetic design. It also puts players in unwinnable positions or softlocks. If a game can only be played one specific way, then the enjoyment and variety is quite limited.

"Kingdom Two Crowns is a masterpiece in its class, it is an extremely simple game yet also complex. You can only use three buttons and two of them are for moving left and right, but with the last button brings a plethora of things to do.

The Co-op is amazing, very fun to play with a friend and is just a very chill game, although co-op makes the game a little too easy for someone like me who's put over 100hrs into all the variations of the game.

I feel as though the islands are a little boring in Two Crowns, as for the same unlockables are all on the same islands and aren't uniquely placed randomly like in New Lands. 

Two Crowns offers new content as well, a new material above stone which adds a huge layer of content to be consumed.

One problem with Two Crowns which really bothers me, it lacks a certain grind which I feel should be present as it is in New Lands, you hardly ever stay on the same island for more than 10 days in Co-op and you can never really endlesslly travel to constantly changing new islands like in New Lands, its only the same few islands.

That's pretty much all I have to say, overall it's a damn great game.

"As a person who played the original kingdom back in 2015 I will definitely say that with each new title (New Lands and now Two Crowns) the content and overall game experience has only improved! Also, as a person who has over 75 hours on this game (mainly because it’s fun trying to beat the game in one reign on different modes and I might be slightly addicted but that’s beside the point) this game is quite relaxing and if you are a person who just likes to mellow out and have a nice casual gaming experience with or without friends then I highly recommend Kingdom Two Crowns.

[hr][/hr]
The Pros:

-Soundtrack: The soundtrack is probably one of my favorite things in this game! It is definitely one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time.

-Art Style: The art style is another lovely thing about this game. I love the animations of the rain hitting the water and the gorgeous backgrounds!
-Mounts: There is a nice variety of mounts a monarch can choose from, and each with their own unique abilities.

-Co-op: The Co-op experience is a LOT of fun. Playing with a friend and journeying through the campaign together is a lovely experience.

-Gameplay: The gameplay is not too difficult to understand and once you grasp the basic mechanics of the game it makes it that much more enjoyable. The addition of Deadlands also allows for the monarchs to have abilities which at times is quite useful! Additionally, the fact that ninjas are implemented in Shogun is enough for me!

-Challenge Islands: The challenge islands are where the more experienced players get put to the test in various ways. Whether it is fighting endless waves of greed or protecting a wolf pup the challenge islands can keep you on your toes.

-Seasons: In Kingdom 2015 there was various whether but no seasons. In New Lands there were four seasons but once winter arrived it never ended. However, in Two Crowns there are actual looping seasons that are each 16 days long. I loved this concept, because it allows for a monarch to survive the winter and await the coming spring.

-Defeating the Greed: [spoiler] I thoroughly like the added part where the monarch and an escort of either two squires/knights can destroy the greed’s home in the cave by blowing it up. It adds a lot to the game as a whole. [/spoiler]
[hr][/hr]
The Cons:
Now I want to preface this by saying that these cons are a bit nit-picky.

-Repetitiveness: My issue with the game play is quite repetitive and can be a bit grindy at times but for me I feel that the survival aspect of the game outshines the repetitiveness.

-Greed Variety: The greed are the enemies that are after the monarch’s crown. The concept of the greed is excellent I just wish there was a bit more of a variety of the types of greed. However, the implementation of the crown stealer was a nice touch for Two Crowns.

-Co-op Difficulty and Overall Difficulty: I have found that with two monarchs it makes the game twice as easy. If there was a way to set the game to a harder difficulty for co-op play it could make the experience more thrilling! The overall game difficulty with only one player is still a bit on the easier side (especially in dead lands with monarch abilities). New Lands definitely had a tougher difficulty but once the days are in the hundreds the difficulty does get a lot harder in Two Crowns.

Overall, I absolutely adore this game! I would recommend it to anyone who wants a casual and fun experience.

Sure there is a tiny tutorial at the start, but it does not tell you that the up key is your hero skill, or that shift key is your mount skill. Aside from that tiny tutorial, the game does not tell you anything else and it will ruin many first time players. For example cutting down trees around camps will make them disappear rendering you unable to recruit new people or get rid of your trader.

"*Update* 2/26/2022 - Revising my review to positive.  A lot of my complaints below have been resolved by updates over time and QoL is generally much higher now.  Having a lot of fun playing this again with my partner lately.

So here's the thing. I have enjoyed this game quite a bit, and man, it is beautiful.  The game design and aesthetics are quite good.

The problem is... the game doesn't always follow its own rules, and it has a very frustrating way of teaching you.  On one hand, it's a lot of fun to learn how the different types of lackeys want to behave automatically.  But, it's annoying af to discover how buildings work and what they'll require, because doing the wrong thing at the wrong time makes you basically lose the entire campaign.  Plus, sometimes the lackeys just aren't consistent at all.  During the daytime they may just refuse to go out of the base.  Hunters will stare at rabbits a screen away and never go get them.  Unarmed lackeys will never go outside the base to get weapons just sitting there, even during the daytime.  Building up your base may or may not cause other supporting buildings to be erected.

"Relaxing background music and retro type. Build, expand and defend. 

At first glance it doesn't seems like something you would hooked up for hours but its simple concept of game-play and bgm would make you to do something more. There are lot of things but still I think it should have more content. There are 5 levels as maps in which you defend your base from the enemies coming out of portals, as the day passes more enemies will raid your base. There are 5 seasons all together (autumn, spring, summer, rainy and winter). As the title suggest its a two-player (non PvP) game. Expand your base by recruiting and building, make your own kingdom, defend it, show your dominance and be the king the land needs.

"I've always enjoyed playing and watching the Kingdom series as it has grown, all the way back to Kingdom: Nothing Lasts, up to the most recent and most updated Kingdom: Two crowns. There has just been always something about its visual style, soundtrack and overall game-play that has really appealed to me as a lover of simple resource management/tower defence games, even if Kingdom doesn't quite fit those descriptions perfectly, it just sits right in my mind.

Basically, you should get it, whether you've seen some game-play before or are just looking through whats on sale at the moment, so long as you enjoy a simple themed game and is easy to learn and harder to master, you're going to love Kingdom. I'd also recommend checking out the original two game, Kingdom: Nothing Lasts and Kingdom: New Lands, because they are both still great games, even if they aren't getting quite the same amount of love as K: TC is nowadays.

So yeah, get the game. It's good fun and has heaps of replay-ability in my opinion. I hope this helped you decide on whether you'll buy it or not.",True,1606640794

"In Kingdom games you, as the monarch, shall protect your crown from falling into the hands of the greed, evil creatures that steal any kind of stuff that you have or that may help you expand your empire (gold, equipment, the crown, ...).  To avoid this, the monarch must recruit people to serve as archers, farmers, knights, etc., and build walls to prevent the greed from attacking him/her and his/her personnel. Both on Kingdom New Lands and Kingdom Two Crowns, the monarch may build a boat to travel to other islands to encounter new mounts, statues, and hermits to help in defeating the greed.

Kingdom Two Crowns is the sequel of Kingdom Classic and Kingdom New Lands, bringing more gameplay enhancements to the Kingdom series. In my opinion, the most notable enhancements are:

* Islands can be cleared from the greed. The last level of the castle allows the monarch to purchase a bomb that may be dropped inside of mountain portals. On explosion, the bomb closes the mountain portal permanently, preventing the greed from coming in that portal's direction. With both mountain portals closed, the island is clear from the greed.
* Multiplayer is now available. The islands seem larger than those of previous Kingdom games so it's nice to play in co-op because each side of the castle can be protected by one player. This helps in decreasing a little bit the game difficulty and making it more enjoyable since both you and your pal will be eager to ask one another whether the other side of the castle is fine (especially on blood moons).
* The game now has a winter season during which is harder to gain gold. Farms don't grow and bunnies don't appear.
* Statues now cost gems to activate and stay active permanently.
* New types of mounts to help you take care of the greed.
* New types of monarchs with skills.

In short, this is a not so complicated platform game that may provide a bunch of enjoyable hours of gameplay. Really recommend playing with a friend.

love it .. the dlc is easier than the main game and the mounts do make a marked difference 
in the gameplay in a good way .. the main game feels harder and slower as a result 
but if you have 13 to 50 hours a night spare this game is for you lol

quite a change from the other games in the series 
more items and more things too unlock as you go along

Based on previous comments and reviews on this game from years ago, people have always complained about this, and the developers have always promised some change to ""make winter more engaging for the player"", but that's clearly never going to happen.

"A buggy mess which irrevocably penalizes you for making uninformed and impulsive decisions. Tell a builder to chop down a tree in the wrong place by accident? That guy is doomed now.

Invest in a statue without knowing what it does by looking online? Congrats, you've just granted your knights the ability to leap into battle, which exposes them and leads to their inevitable death. Wanna hire a hermit to give you a boost? Great, now he's turned your best tower into a useless bakery. Can't with NO ability to save a game and reload after mistake (short of Alt+F4 forcequitting), and no way to undo errors, it makes for a harsh experience. My wife and I played together, and were forced into restart after restart as we realize that the unfixable (and in many instances, impossible to determine ahead of time) errors we'd made would lead to inevitable failure.
I wanted to like this game, I really did. But the fact that there are multiple campaigns at this point, each of them filled with useless options (Most of the mounts are not worth getting, half of the hermits are worthless, and some statues actively hurt your gameplay). Heck, when I finished the ""Dead Lands"" campaign, as a reward I was treated to credit sequence which had multiple tracks of music playing simultaneously, ultimately an unskippable cacophonous mess. This game is desperately in need of patching and reworking. If the developers claim that it is as intended, then it is actively a bad game.",False,1606427903
Even without reading up this game will teach you by way of necessity. Its fantastic mix of simple tactics and interesting mechanisms make for an addicting title. I just cannot let the greed win.

"The best way I can describe this is like a 2D sidescrolling tower defense. I've seen some people comment on lack of control over the npcs, but that's par for the course in a tower defense, so if you're not interested in strategy and timing based around how well you've set things up, this may not be the game for you. But if that's not the case, I do recommend this! The art and aesthetic as well as an interesting way to play something similar to tower defense but with more freedom and choices for you as the player makes for a great time sucker. You can grab a friend and play remotely which is a huge help especially when you're stuck.

It fixes all the little issues the previous ones had with NPC movements and the tear-down of trees destroying hermit buildings while adding more.

The switch for the hermit and better building materials to require gems rather than coins creates a bit more of a challenge but I like it because it gives you more to do. The ability to set sail without having to travel to the dock is also a huge bonus since that would normally take a few days in game. Overall, I am super happy with the changes they made. The Dead Lands mode is absolutely stunning and so enjoyable to play even without having played Bloodstained. There are other special mechanics in this mode too that I found exciting once I figured it out too. So if you enjoyed the other games, you'll really like this one.",True,1606412653

Anyways, I love the graphics, the simplistic game play controls, and the fact that no matter how many times one might die (pfft... who does that anymore) you can start a new monarchy in the same greedy lands that you built up (this time, they're just slightly beat up like you were).

"TL;DR: Fuck Winter.


I really tried to enjoy this game. However, after sinking 30 hours into this game, it honestly was not worth the time investment. There's some jarring issues that turn this game from happy times to frustrating that made me realise my time is well spent playing/doing something else.

I'm going to skip the good stuff and get straight to the problems in this game:

Winter- I have never seen a game mechanic waste more time in a video game than this one. Winter stops all coin generation from all but a few sources, and if you don't have these sources already setup(which a new player will not) you LITERALLY have to AFK for an hour real time waiting for winter to end. (Each day/night cycle lasts about 4 minutes, each season is 16 days, thats 64 minutes). Pray you finish the game before the second winter rolls around.

I had the rather misfortune of clearing an island just as winter begun forcing me to have the game run in the background for an hour as travelling to a new island during Winter is suicide.

Difficulty - This game punishes you for taking your time or doing things in the wrong order(did i mention Winter?). There are two things that determine difficulty, time and portals. Time resets when you die, portals do not. You return to the first island when you die.

The game forces you to explore up to the 4th island before you can clear them of the enemy due to an unlock. Every island has two sides to it, right and left. One leads to the pier, one leads to the cliff. If you clear the wrong side, it makes the game much harder later on. When you destroy a portal, the enemy can retaliate with a wave up to 40 times the strength of a normal wave.

This is generally fine unless you haven't cleared/returned to the first island already, in which case when you do return you will need to quickly build to brick, have enough people, pay for enough archers and survive the 30 + wave of enemies each night. If you fail this, you respawn back on the first island. Time resets, but your portal count does not, so destroying any portal leads to your death once again.

I ran into a (bug?)problem where returning to the first island on day 90 and dying did not despawn the enemy, causing me to respawn and die instantly over and over.",False,1604908493

"This game is so unbelievably lame. The trailers and presentation on the store page would have you believe that this disaster is an exploration and kingdom building game, recruiting serfs to serve your empire. In reality, this is a rogue-like designed to be a game easily picked up and easily lost. When you lose, you start all over again at the very beginning with nothing to show for the wasted 1-2 hours you wasted in that run. It gets even more tedious than that because when you actually achieve something and go to the next island, the kingdom you left behind starts to decay because you are not there, forcing you to bounce back and forth across the different islands so that everything doesn't fall apart.

"I liked Kingdom and Kingdom: New Lands. Played the heck out of the latter. It was challenging, sometimes caught me offguard, but otherwise was balanced enough and gave me a real sense of satisfaction when completing each island.

Kingdom Two Crowns has very little of that satisfaction from the previous titles. While some Quality of Life implementations (slightly better AI, minor guidance to advanced upgrades, archers will arch from behind walls if bored) are certainly welcome and expected in a sequel, other additions make the game overall too easy. 

Upgrades to walls, archers, farmers, and knights are now permanent and not island-dependent. While I do kind of like that idea, since you're supposed to be cleansing an entire land (five base islands), like...perhaps there should have been something in the home base, spells you could summon for a recurring cost. Instead, it's a base payment of special gems - the new currency only used to unlock the ability to purchase unique upgrades with gold - with the ability to repurchase on subsequent playthroughs. It makes the game a cakewalk, truly. 

Much of my time was spent just sitting around, waiting for my farms to come to fruition, my archers to hunt, and my pikeman to...stand around, hardly fishing. I waited a lot in this game. The tension I felt at night, after amassing six knights, 30 archers, catapults, and invincible towers was, you know, minimal. During winter now, too, you can just sit inside your base, cozy as a clam, until spring rolls around.

There are also technical bugs pertaining to AI behavior. Farmers will not farm new berry bushes during winter, even when paid for. Pikeman do not fish during winter, despite that being an advertised benefit to alleviate the pangs of winertime. PIkeman seem to die instantly during fights, their pikes useless. Builders seem slow. AI will get caught in conflicting pathways in your home base, unable to make a decision on where to go. Certain shops will not appear despite wall upgrades and land expansion. But hey free cosmetic DLC is fun right.

I'm disappointed in this. I got my 20 hours out of it, which is all I expect out of games these days, but I can't say it was all that much fun.",False,1604703314
"This is a fun, 2D, side scrolling, basic kingdom management game that is simplistic but difficult. You are a monarch that pays peasants to do essentially everything you could want; build, farm and fight. There is an enemy called the Greed that comes every night to try and take your crown (if they do it results in a game over), with the exceptions of this rule being the blood moon when they spawn a super wave of greed, and the night after the blood moon, where none spawn at all.  Without giving too many spoilers here’s a brief synopsis of the new parts of the game. 

It is a combination of the first 2 games with the same base mechanics but now with co-op, a campaign, a shogun style map (and unique warrior for said map), and a few other additional features such as new special mounts, merchants, gems and new ‘ages’ (i.e. stone/iron age). 
The campaign features 5 islands in which your goal is to overcome the Greed on all five of them by destroying all portals on the island, including the cliff portal (requires iron keep and the bomb). 
The gems (which are a finite currency you find in chests in the wild) . The gems are highly valuable as they are the only way to unlock the shrines, new mounts, and merchants (you will still have to pay coins for them to make use of them). There is a storage for them to prevent you from losing them but it doesn’t unlock until your keep is made of stone brick (the 6th upgrade of the keep, also requires the stone mine before being able to purchase). 
The new mounts can be very powerful with the lizard (or dragon if you prefer) being able to single handedly hold off a night of greed. All the mounts come with a special ability besides the starter horse and the unsaddled wild horse.
The merchants are used to upgrade your kingdom’s buildings to a unique tier that will just improve them and/or give them unique abilities.

Now onto the actual review:
The gems are an acceptable addition to the game as they are not necessary, they unlock the more powerful tools of the game but it isn’t the end if you lose them (just really frustrating), however the game would not suffer much if they didn’t exist either (Would make the game slightly easier). Personally I enjoy the aspect of the gems as you have to plan when to grab them so the Greed don’t take them from you. The mounts are very fun and I enjoy them wholeheartedly, a great addition to the game. The merchants are a good change to the game giving new upgrades to buildings that range from ‘very useful’ to ‘somewhat convenient’. I welcome them to the game. 

A minor gripe I have is the lack of information. There is a friendly ghost that will occasionally give advice/tool tips but for the majority of the game (like 95%) you will have to figure it out on your own. Not the worst thing, but for new players I would definitely recommend a guide before/while playing or once you start feeling frustrated about certain features.

A major negative for me is the bugs (a minor bug I don’t really care about is that not all but a majority of Steam achievements don’t work and will randomly unlock rather than when you have actually done what is required for the achievement). Now let it be known i have not encountered a lot of bugs, but the few I have were infuriating. 
To name a couple: 
the Greed destroy your walls and begin taking tools away and die before reaching their portal, if the tools are not close enough to your keep, peasants that are already recruited (most likely the ones that survived the raid) or recruited and do not directly walk over them,  will ignore their existence requiring you to get new tools (especially frustrating when you barely just scraped through that raid and have no money for new tools). 
In the winter berries spawn and you pay a coin for your farmer(s) to go harvest them and they simply don’t. This bug makes the winter almost unplayable as there is no other way to generate income reliably in the winter.

Overall a fun game that builds on the previous ones but has a few bugs and features that can be frustrating at times making the game feel unpolished.
",True,1604702318
"As few other reviews stated before, the game has serious problems in terms of game design. From the visual side, the game is very good, breathtaking even. But when it comes to gameplay it has so many logic errors it loses all its charm and starts becoming frustrating. Just to give a few examples:

- You have no idea which building does what. Places that require your diamond, which is given to you in very limited amounts have no explanation. They are just there, and you can only learn by experimenting or searching for it on the internet. That's not acceptable.

- From some of those places, you can recruit hermits which unlock buildings only they can build. But let's say something happened and you let them get caught, you lost them. You can only recruit them again if you build a ship, go to another island, and go back. Just to inform you, if you don't have lighthouses in those islands, every time you leave, those ships get wrecked and need to be rebuilt to use again.

- AI is stupid. Workers go to do your task at night and die. Or if they get attacked while building they just stop and stay there, doing nothing until the new day comes.

- You can build watchtowers to defend your base but if you build your walls further, archers do not leave their towers and stay there forever.

- Melee units during night leaps outside of walls to attack and die.

- There is a very limited character creation ""loading screen"" where you can choose your character. That's okay, it can be limited, but the problem is that you can't choose it. You just keep pushing the same button until something that catches your eye gets randomized.

- The same thing with character creation happens if you want to change your banner. You can't choose a fucking color for your fucking banner. You just keep randomizing colors until something you like comes.

The list just keeps going. If the game was in early access, it would be acceptable but it's full version and the studio doesn't seem to be working on fixes but rather new content. So I guess they are content with the current situation. The game is not the worst but I suggest buying it on a sale. 

English is not my main language as you probably guessed, so I'm sorry if there are any grammar errors. Thanks for reading my review.",False,1604701759
"If you like a good game with a lot of frustration, then this is for you. otherwise stay away.

first 2 islands are OK, afterwards it goes down hill.
First the winter mechanic, I didn't know about it when I reached the 3rd island and it started there, had 2 walls only zero gold can't farm or hunt so all you can do is wait till they break through and open your arms.

Second the AI is not stupid but Evil, in a new Island I have 3 hunters, plenty of chickens on the left wall and nothing on the right wall, guess where they group at? if you said right then you are right, and this happened to me on  several gameplays.

only way to progress in this game is to go to a new island, build your foundation, die to no gold, restart a new play through then return to that island and continue on that foundation, and hope it's enough otherwise repeat the previous step.

---The worst thing in this game, by far, is---

Lack. Of. Control.

Pretty ironic that a King or Queen has fucking no control over what happens, right?

You are given THE LOOSEST definition of control, being able to kinda just... nudge people to do something, if that at all. The most control you have is when you raid a cave and the knights and archers directly follow you. Thats it.

Theres SO MANY ISSUES that come out of not being able to have a higher extent of control, let me list some, this is an AI issue too.

-Archers not hunting, and staying inside towers that are wayyyy too far inside your castle, and becoming basically useless. Archers who become part of squads also wont hunt, and archers apart of towers wont hunt either.
-Builders throwing themselves into death by running out way tooo far of the walls to build, and then getting themselves killed. This happens forever until the building is complete, and you cant cancel buildings.
-Knights throwing themselves out of the wall with the leap attack and dying, also not picking up coins, even when they still have space left.
-Farmers not going inside the walls when night comes, causing them to die. This also repeats forever aslong as you have farmers. Even when a wall is RIGHT NEXT ot them, they dont even try to run.
-Not being able to stop ninjas and pikemen from fishing when you want to conserve their durability
-Units staying on one side, even when the other side is already done.

How could we solve all this? more controls and things. LITERALLY more options to influence the kingdom.

---My ideas for some new ways to control your subjects---

Wrangling - Wrangling would make it so that you could pay subjects a single coin, and they would follow you for a short amount of time. You could cancel this by rapidly turning left and right, like you do with hermits to dismount them.

The purpose of this would be to help with archers not hunting, farmers not going inside, and units not rallying to one side even when the other side is done, it'd also protect builders from running out.

Opening/Closing - Opening and Closing would be a way to well, open or close towers. If a tower is closed, you can be prompted to open it, and if its opened you can be prompted to close it, like an on off switch. Closing a tower makes all the archers in it dismount, and roam around as usual. This also prevents other archers from getting in. Opening a tower will make it function like normal. It would cost 2 coins to open or close a tower, and requires a builder to come over.

The purpose of this would to help archers not be useless, and when you need to sacrifice towers for economy.

Destroying - Destroying would be where you could pay a builder to destroy a building, taking longer depending on how strong the building is. T

The purpose for this would to get rid of towers/walls you don't want, such as accidentally making them. Towers that are too far out also become subject traps, losing archers endlessly. 

Canceling - Canceling would be like destroying but for buildings in-construction, where you could pay coins to destroy the building. This would NOT require a builder (For obvious reasons.)

The purpose of this would be to prevent in-construction buildings from becoming builder traps.

Some extra things i'd like to see.
-Farmers automatically entering the kingdom when night comes.
-Knights only using leap during the day
-Archers automatically dismounting towers when day comes
-Being able to pay archers/pikemen to lock them onto either fishing/defending at all times
-Units automatically moving to the dock side if cave is destroyed, or the cave side if dock is destroyed.

---But no---

None of these things exist. You are at the whim of the shoddy AI and stupid lack of control.

five years and three games, and the control and AI still suck as much as it did in the first games first version ever.





Edit - 2021 

I see some of you talking about ""Oh my god. You retard. This is how the game was meant to be. You know what you got when you played this game""

No, no. I dont remember buying this game just to get FUCKED over by shit for brains A.I that feels like its on the Greed's side half the time. I didnt buy this game to deal with A.I that has less common sense that A.I from NES games do. I didnt to have to deal with FARMERS, BUILDERS AND KNIGHTS WHO KILL THEMESELVES.

The biggest thing thats pissing me off is that these dudes are like ""Go play an RTS bro, you're not some god who can control everyone"" 

You talk about realism and are like ""Brooo its like this cause its realistic!"" and then I watch as my builders begin to form a mountain of their own dead bodies to take down a single tree, and farmers stand still as Greed rip them apart.

In all of my suggestions, do you SEE anything that seems unrealistic? Everything I said, canceling, wrangling, destroying all of it. Requires you to FUCKING BE AT WHERE YOU WANT TO DO IT. You still literally would have to travel around manually and make the orders, manually, it wouldnt be like an RTS you stupid assholes.

3. troops using actual medieval tactics and strategies,doesnt need to be something special but based on survivalbility for the troops. And engineers throwing boiling oil over the greed from the top of the walls
4. Engineers being able to do more than just catapults and tower upgrade catapult. For them to as listed before this, to use tactics such as throwing boiling oil from the walls,making traps, putting stacks of logs on the top of the walls,digging trenches,etc.
5. Someone to act as some sort of tax collecter, when you are absent for a long period of time, the money that the farmers make is chaos, so it would be good to add them and make them collect money when the player is away doing stuff,and when they collect the money they bring it to the banker

over all i like the game but i belive that there is more to do",True,1603919210
"Pros:
Super fun with a friend
Takes a short amount of time
Can carry around floating glitched coins which is awesome
Can run on a trash laptop
great graphics
Something new to play 

Cons:
Doesn't tell you ability control
Doesn't tell you important information
Online lags really bad
Making farms that work takes half your brain
Having farmers actually go it the farm is also brain damaging
Not much content after completing everything
You will forever see ghosts that will either give you the most obvious advice or something absolutely useless

SUMMARY OF KINGDOM TWO CROWNS IN 60 WORDS (plus 1)
you build up a camp with coins that people with bows get through deers or rabbits (give up on deers unless you have an elk) and build up defences with builders (people who have hammers). Build up enough coins to survive waves of bad people at night that progressively get harder each night and sail for the island for better resources.

𝙏𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙨 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙩𝙝𝙞𝙨 𝙜𝙖𝙢𝙚 𝙙𝙤𝙚𝙨𝙣'𝙩 𝙩𝙚𝙡𝙡 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙨𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙡𝙙 𝙠𝙣𝙤𝙬:
Farming: Sometimes your farmers don't go the the farm even though you built one
Abilities: Game doesn't tell you how to use your characters ability ( dead lands ) or your mount ( which can be really important in dead lands )
Bomb: It also tells you nothing of the bomb and that it takes up the knights to use it, and sometimes your knight's archers are defending a wall or out on a raid to destroy a portal and run back to escort the bomb.

All in all:
Super fun with a friend but gets old quick, great for something new but doesn't tell you important details about the game. Will slaughter you if you don't know what your doing but that makes it even more fun with a friend who is just as useless as you are.
Would recommend but i wish there was more content and told me sooner about the abilities ( rip my dog, got snatched by green people at night )

"I have a friend who gives me grief for playing 2D games, but with Kingdom 2 Crowns he can now give me grief for playing 1D games: You just run left, run right, and throw coins... but it is great.

Recruit homeless people to use the tools and weapons you buy for them in your town center, expand the range of your walls, upgrade your town center, invest in the treasury, upgrade your walls, build guard posts, fight off waves of Greed (monsters) every night. Expand more, build farms, repair the ship, move on to the next island and do the same thing except secure unique resources that allow you to upgrade your buildings to even higher tiers, and unlock magical shrines. Oh and you can travel between your different islands, you dont just abandon them.

Really fun, mostly relaxing game  (some of the attacks can be stressful later on trust me). Great as a split screen or remote play game or non-split screen online.

The two variations, Shogun and Dead Lands, are basically the same but with different aesthetics and music. Though Dead Lands does give your main character a special ability to more directly fight the Greed, such as a whip that sends a freezing wave out in front of you.

10/10 would unsarcastically buy 1D game again.

"Edit:  Steam asked me for another review.

The devs have continually refined and added content long after release.  While originally it was little more than the original with some added annoyances, now it's a good game and stands on it's own.  A little bit of love can go a long way with games.  Bug fixes, more content, more challenges, balance patches, etc... 
 Still a Kingdom game for better or for worse but definitely worth a thumbs up at this point.

Old Review:

Really like the first two, but not this one.  Basically they amped up everything that was annoying, and dialed down everything that was interesting.

The 'gem' currency system is just dumb (like I wanted even less room in my wallet...).  You spend even more time just running back and forth than you did previously.  There's still no UI to speak of so you have no idea what's going on without running for 10min to the other side of the map.  Unit AI is even worse, with your men constantly running off and dying for no reason.  Losing means you restart at the very beginning, because I wanted to lose 3hours of playtime and replay the first map over multiple times.

Its a game where trial and error is necessary, and yet punishes you for doing just that.  Do everything right, and its not even a yawn worthy challenge.  But make any small/noobish mistakes and you're pretty much SOL with no recourse but to lose hours worth of play time simply because you wanted to try something different.

I could go on.  In the end I just found it annoying, tedious, and poorly designed.",True,1602506648

But really, this game is very addictive and I could honestly play it for 12 hours straight and not notice the time that has gone by. 

Micro-management is one of the tags and if you love those types of games, I recommend this very highly. Progression and survival is also a big thing in this game and you have to fight and fend off greed that will attack each night to try and steal your crown. It's up to you to build walls, an army and a kingdom that can survive the tough nights and fight back by destroying portals and eventually blowing up the cave to put a stop to them once and for all. 

The music is also incredible as it matches the atmosphere of where you are on the island, I don't know how they did it but they've smashed it.

I would give a 9.9/10 (no game is perfect but this is very very close) because I can't really mark it down on anything, it does everything perfectly.

"[h1]Same with new contents and yet, so much more...![/h1]
The successful indie ground-breaker keeps expanding itself with its third outing, which holds the same gameplay core but diversifies with new contents including the Shogun civilization, additional mounts, game modes and even a new endgame! The latter ensures that there is a goal to reach when expanding and reinforcing your realm across the islands.

One would think that releasing the same product with some additional gameplay cores and extra features for the same price is a common practice for the makers of Kingdom. However, Two Crowns got a major spring update ""Dead Lands"" in 2020 that adds in characters from Bloodstained, new island sceneries and new mounts. The substantial difference is that every character you play and unlock (from their cages) have special abilities that can affect your workflow and enemy encounters. Playing and actively switching between those monarchs have me thinking and executing new strategies, which yielded a refresher for gameplay. Though I have come upon a few bugs, none were large enough to ruin the experience.

Although I haven't tried the multiplayer mode of its namesake, there are contents enough to warrant a fresh experience as a single player, too. Two Crowns is what I consider an enhanced version of its predecessor New Lands and if you are new to the Kingdom franchise, this latest release provides the best value.",True,1600016481

The one thing I can praise the game for is its looks. It has magnificent pixel art and every part of it looks pristene, but that isn't nearly enough to justify a 20 dollar purchase.

The game is thoroughly enjoyable and can be played with a single friend in a call, or just solo.  There's a lot I like about it.

"The Good
Overall a very nice game to play couch-coop, and even though I have some complaints (see below), I still highly recommend it. Especially as a coop game (couch or otherwise). The game looks simple, yet takes effort to master. It requires strategizing, team-work, and beating it together is very satisfying. In the limited space of PC couch-coop titles, this is one of my favorites.

The Less Good
The only thing that I think was a bit lacking is the in-game explanation of the game mechanics. It would be nice if you could see what a specific mount/hermit/statue can do for you before you spent precious gems on them. There is a ghost that sometimes follows you to tell you what to do, however, to me this is usually less than helpful. I realize this is probably by design, and I could imagine some people like having to figure the rules of the game out by trial and error, but I found it more frustrating than enjoyable. 

Lastly, I've experienced a number of bugs that required me to restart the game every so often (on linux, perhaps it's different on other platforms). It's not to the point that the game is not playable, but it is a bit of an inconvenience.",True,1598722067

I can't tell you why I love this game so much, but I do. Buy it if you want to be strangely immersed in an ambiguous atmosphere that is strangely satisfying once you figure it out.

Exploration, strategy, growth, mystery and ambiance are just some of the core game mechanics of this game.

it's good survival practice,True,1597420388
"A complicated game, despite it's simple mechanics. Gold starts become more valuable as the days pass by, as is the need for safety and shelter. I think it was was when I lost my puppers that I realized that I have been too kind in ignoring the Greed for the prosperity of my land and that I should make like the Doomslayer and blow up their home. It's been some time since I last played on the PC (Last playthrough was on the Switch), but lets see if I can't establish a trade route like I did before. Here's hoping they fixed the nightowl builder problem.",True,1597379953
"I love this game! The mechanics are simple and the overall experience is satisfying and relaxing I highly recommend it. this particular edition is much longer than the previous edition as worlds aren’t forfeit upon death.  

Note: I play exclusively single player so I cannot speak for multiplayer mechanics.

Base game: pros- there are a handful of changes to strategy from previous versions. All in all these, mounts, structures, and jobs feel well balanced and add to the classic kingdom experience imo. I particularly enjoy the gryphon mount it’s wonderful and playing solo I demand speed.

Cons: there’s a few bugs but I find the only alt delete worthy is one where  gems occasionally “rain” magically from the bottom of the pouch to the far foreground and into the sea seemingly at random. As for mechanics I’m terrified of the “crown stealer” and wish it was not faster than the fastest mount or marked distinctly. The pikemen seem a little off as only one can be in use at a time and they are the only job that lacks permanence so to speak. i would personally be happier if they kept their pikes and were less effective because the whole “it’s been two nights and the pikemen are gone” almost makes them not worth employing in the first place. I’d really appreciate an update (or mod) where idle npc’s didn’t walk back and forth in front of the coffer as that above all other mechanics frustrates me.

Shogun: all mechanically the same aside from ninjas instead of pikemen. I personally don’t like the ninjas I wish they had just re skinned the pikemen because the ninjas need trees to be effective and that’s just one more thing to worry about. The art overall is gorgeous.

Dead lands: much of the same. the art style is very macabre and the endgame structure design leaves a lot to be desired, the walls never look “done”. There’s a whole new monarch mechanic which is great and the monarchs are the only good looking thing in the whole dlc stabicorn aside. this dlc is the worst of the lot to me. You just can’t move quickly enough base horse is the fastest mount and ugly on top of that. Despite the ultra fast bat mode one of the monarchs offers. this dlc just seems to be under done which is a pity as I really like the macabre but that doesn’t have to mean ugly. Still all the problems I have here are only personal preference and I’m sure someone who doesn’t mind a slow mount and doesn’t care about what the npcs look like as long as pc looks awesome will have a great time.

Still I highly recommend this game and all the dlc. press up and down on the loading screen to change monarchs",True,1597367966

"Ayee! SO this games first off is more intricate then meets the eye. Other than the amazing pixel animations the sound effects and attention to detail is outstanding! There are several versions/ themes which include Shogun (which is almost Japanese themed with some yen looking currency, ninjas as warriors, and a cool samurai monarch, as well as MUCH much more), and there's Dead Lands (it contains mounts, the monarch's transportation,  that look kinda zombie like because they got exposed bones and stuff, monarchs with diverse powers, and interesting display of skull statues in the background.). These are the main two that I know of besides the ""OG"" Kingdom 2 Crowns.

Alrighty, here's the downish side to this game. First off, there is NO tutorial whatsoever! Ok there is a small one in the beginning where a dead monarch comes and says ""chuck a coin here"" or ""two together are stronger"" or some saying. But that definitely isn't enough to fully explain the objective or even the other basics of the game at all!
 
AH, I actually played this with a friend of mine a few years back and we had no clue what to do so we just roamed around and built boats and walls, la de daa and moved onto the next island WITHOUT evening like giving a slight fight to the Greed (which are the monsters that attack each night (literally a ""whole day"" in the game is 5 minutes take more or less) ). Now that we are more ""experienced"" in a way, we have done research to find out that we have to completely wipe out the Greed in all of the five islands. ""Chuck a seven coins here"" isn't going to fight some purple crown stealing monsters...

Next off I love that fact you have the option of playing multiplayer or single! It works for everyone, but I would like to say that multiplayer is much more efficient, yet single player also gives you the chance of doing things at your own pace :)
But! Playing with that same friend I mentioned before, when we used to play locally it was much easier with your simple keyboard of WASD and the Up down left right key buttons as well as a split screen. Things went a lot smoother and we could communicate right next to one another. But due to quarantine, we now play unlocally (if thats a word lol) and communication is still strong between us because we usually video call while playing, but the actions are A LOT more laggy! May I mention that theres also much more glitching, are monarch's have disappeared from one another's screens and there've been times where our crowns also went missing BUT with FULL BAGS of money and no sign of Greed. Like whatttttttttt happened ahhh. Another glitch that happened is that the villagers were walking back to the kingdom but instead they were like sliding and facing the opposite direction but still moving towards the camp... (more like moon walking if you ask me B) ) I do hope theres a future update to fix this!

All in all, this game is great! Especially if you want something thats a little at your own pace but still gives you adrenaline from the oncoming attacks from monsters. BUT! If you want to know the actual basics of the game research (much emphasis on this)!!!! That is key! Other than that if you want to completely find things on your own, hey you do you. I'd give this an 7/10 overall! Thats all folks!
                                                                                                                                               - Kay

The game is the perfect example of skinner box repetition. This plagues a lot of indie survival games but this game takes the cake. Build the same fortress over and over again.

This is a tower defense/resource building game where you play as a king gathering taxes from your citizens and dispensing the money to upgrade and maintain your defenses and armies to fight off monsters that seem to be inspired by Noface from Spirited away, little gremlin things that are out to steal your gold and wreck your stuff. 

The day/night and weather cycles combined with the soundtrack really suck you in, and there's some neat stuff to unlock like new mounts, some of which allow you to fight, troop upgrades, catapults, ballistas, etc.

I do wish you had more fine grained control over your archers and knights and could tell them where to go, maybe by planting a flag or something.

A lot of other reviewers are complaining about winter, and I would have to agree... I always make sure that I know when winter is coming so I'm on a well-secured island so I can... let the game run while I go take a shower or read something, hiring new people with the money I saved from Not Winter. I usually head out to a new island as soon as spring hits, and it's been treating me pretty well. That said, no one really likes a mechanic that you have to just kinda sit around on, so I can understand why people don't like that. It really doesn't bother me too much, though.

But it stuck with me in the back of  my mind, and my second day owning this game, I reinstalled, restarted a fresh campaign, and tried out a few things new things and I really enjoyed myself.  So here I am, recanting my last review and hoping that this will save someone else from running into the same severe disappointment I had my first day playing.

So, first things first, this game tells you nothing, absolutely nothing.  The tutorial tells you the very very basics and that's it.  The rest of the information out there is because people learned through an insane amount of trial and error and plugged it into the wiki.  The game shows no information on any of the buildings or how to use any new lemmings you manage to unlock, and yes, I said lemmings, these ""villagers"" make lemmings seem like geniuses, the faster you realize that the sooner you will enjoy this game.  You are going to have so many unanswered questions when you start that your head is going to be swimming for a bit, but if you stick to it, you will begin to realize how things work and you will find yourself enjoying this very relaxing game.  I'm on day two of owning this game, and I've definitely gotten $14 enjoyment out of it already.  Looking forward to the Iron Age.

A few tips for beginners (some minor spoilers ahead if you want to discover everything fresh yourself):  

- The most important thing is to be careful of camps, do not cut down the last tree leading up to a lemming camp unless you are absolutely sure you no longer need it, the camps disappear once they are no longer in the forest and you will find yourself in a serious shortage of lemmings.  Leaving one tree on either side of the camp will still be considered in the forest. 

- You can't unbuild anything in this game.  So if you build every tower you come across, your archer lemmings are going to man those towers till forever, even if they are nowhere near the outside walls.  This will slow your outward progression because you will have nobody to guard the wall.  Again, as long as you have camps, building towers will just slow down your progression, you will still progress.

- When you unlock your banker (the little lemming sitting in front of your castle) give him your overflow cash every chance you get, once winter hits, your money production tanks and you will be happy you squirreled away those extra nuts.",True,1594047789

"It's simplistic, 2D, but captivating. It's easy at face value, but the strategy has depth. My first session ended up being 9 hours. Just expand and hopefully you have enough defenses to survive the night. I've paid more money for less captivating games.

"I LOVE many of the visual upgrades (the new empires especially) and gameplay upgrades this game has over new land and classic, but the gems currency system is simply the worst. You have to be constantly aware of not accidentally dropping or using them, to make matters worse they use up the same space in your very limited coin bag. The game goes from fun/casual to tedious/annoying. Its almost not even worth playing for me.",False,1593902961
"I have played this game series since the original and New Lands, and I loved them. Two Crowns is a disappointment and broken mess, I have played a lot and had a good time. But I have had to restart more than halfway into a campaign at least 10 times now due to game breaking bugs. I never had this issue with the previous games. Which makes this so confusing because two crowns is essentially a reskin of new lands with a couple extra game mechanics.",False,1593900544
"Let me just say, I love every part of this game. I have never experienced any bugs, even in 2 player with my daughter. My favorite part of this game is the challenge that I had never expected to face. This game is so deep and so well thought out, it regularly surprises me. The fact that it doesnt hold your hand through the beginning is something that I tell people about happily when describing the game. If you dont know what something does, save the money and invest in it and watch what it does, assess what effect it has on your system as a whole and how it could be beneficial to you. If you cant afford something and are struggling, look for things that can supplement your survival. Winter sucks? Get tougher. Did you know that your pikemen keep employed for 5 days and then drop their equipment? did you know that they make gold appear out of your very walls? Did you know that you can find winterberries and have your farmers gather money from them? Some of them mounts even give you the ability to kill prey and enemies if you just earn it. This game is too hard? try playing some of the SNES games that I had to deal with as a kid. 10 Stars",True,1593892306

"It's a 2d cross between tower defense and mild resource management. I love it, especially the atmosphere. Easy to listen to music in the background of a pixel-art design? sign me up. Max price of $20, and an even better sale price, you can't go wrong with this game if you know you like this sort of thing. Having said that there isn't really much in the way of instructions other than, ""don't die"" or ""spend coins"" and that can leave a bit to be desired, but there's a great community, subreddit, and wiki to address that.

"Amazing game. Simple on the surface with a lot of complexity underneath.
Great music.
Aesthetically pleasing pixel graphics.
For anyone on the fence, definitely worth playing for a chill game with a great soundtrack.

That being said:
@devs...PLEASE do something about the winter mechanic. 
Over and over I come back to this game...but then I remember why I lose interest. The winter.
I love hard games. I really do. I love being challenged. 
But being able to do close to nothing except grab a snack and wait until your kingdom is slowly widdled down feels bad and is poor game design imo.
I think there are more clever ways to ramp up difficulty than removing every source of income from the map.

Outside of that, would recommend.",True,1593706389
"3-hour playtime quick review:
I don't normally enjoy ""tower defense"" type games, but this transcends the genre by simplifying mechanics down to the basics to avoid being bogged down with too many things, while still giving you complete freedom. Then it makes music notes some of its sound effects even going thru scales, and soothing piano background music, to make the game feel welcoming & pleasant.

I played 3 hours straight my first time and only stopped because I had to go to bed.",True,1593706346

"tl;dr: Simple game play, but brutal difficulty with almost zero guidance which can lead to a lot of headaches.

I liked this game for the most part, but I can't recommend it. The art and sound design are fantastic (especially the DLCs), and the controls are super simple. My biggest hang up is all the mystery on what everything does. If there wasn't a fan wiki I wouldn't have made it as far as I did in the first place, but even then a lot of articles over there end with ""at this time we don't know what this does"". It is a game of trial and error and error and error. Eventually I came up with a strategy that let me progress until enemies were destroying stone walls within moments and 'killing' all my guards. There wasn't enough time in a day to recoup the losses and rebuild or strategize. So I was out- done. If I start over I'd be at such a disadvantage one the first night I may as well restart the game and build back up from square one.

I do feel this could be a very shiny diamond in the rough, and is simply marred by no information in game on what anything is. A hover bubble below the item wouldn't be all that intrusive with a read out on what the item or building does. Maybe have the developer head to the wiki site themselves and just fill in all the blanks? Also, how about a way to generate villagers within city walls? Or maybe eject troops from turrets so I can build up a front line defense and move forward without having to sacrifice 1~4 people permanently.",False,1593482064

The main selling point of the game in my opinion is the beautiful pixel art and that is what is really brought out in 2 Crowns and Shogun.

"When it worked, it was fun.  It's broken for Linux, due to the developer needing to update the code or roll it back to support my screen.  I get the Unity ""Black Screen of Nope"".  Tried setting the launch options to disable full screen, etc but no love.

Windows and perhaps Proton, the game should work.

On a side note, the developer stated via Twitter that the support for his game for Linux is up to the users themselves.  That's fine, however, that should be a huge disclaimer when purchasing this game as that's something to note for a user when buying the software.  Secondly, if we get to support it, let's see the source code, because I can already tell where some of the issues arise, in that the game ignores the options passed to Unity and simply ignores them.

When developers update code, or when I can do more diagnosis, I'll consider changing rating.

Update: Looks to work in Proton 7.0.1.  Not changing my rating regardless due to the above.  This doesn't speak to the entertainment of the game.  Completely ignore my review if you use a platform that works, its just a shame that this is the level of ""community support"".",False,1593226083

- Throughtfully designed and memorable characters
- Well executed pixel-art style graphics and animations
- Multiple ""biomes"" (default game, dead lands, shogun) extend the replayability
- Balanced in terms of difficulty (single-player only, I have not played multiplayer)
- Sense of exploration
- Sense of dread when the greed come at you
- Balanced upgrade/customization system - satisfying while not becoming excessively tedious
[b]I did not like[/b]
- Some bugs in terms of building placement.  My return portals failed to give the ""build"" structure many times due to some building proximity constraints I don't understand.
- Lack of meters to help you understand various important metrics (e.g. horse stamina,  money saved in the bank, days until winter, etc.).  There are some visual cues in the environment, but I don't find them always to be as obvious as what I need.
- Order in which workers perform tasks can be particularly frustrating in a time-sensitive game such as this.
- No indicator of how many farm plots will be utilized when building a farm.
- Winter season is particularly tedious.  The berry bushes always seem to spawn extremely far from my camp so I spend tens of daily cycles running back and forth across the entire map trying to get my farmers to forage (which some refuse to do for some reason).
- Lack of full help guide/user manual in-game
- Lack of controls mapping

"I absolutely love this game  but the bugs have just ruined it for me. I've really tried to play it and complete it but i just can't without rage quitting. THE BUGS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.

Bugs i have encountered:
- civs walking around without picking up weapons for more than 2 days
- knights just walking outside the walls and dying at night
- pikers walking outside the walls just casually during a fight
- constant shading bugs (/negative lighting effects on mounts) usually when walking past trees.
-catapult enginners leaving post even with plenty of OTHER engineers nearby during wave or jsut before a wave.
-mounts just freezing in place for a second causing me to lose the dog :( [spoiler]and nearly die to the bomb[/spoiler]
-random coin dropping (minor)
-civs deciding to run all the way back to castle instead of picking up weapon they just dropped (Is this a bug or weirdly intentional)
-Super loud noise when leaving island compared to normal game sound
-hermits deciding to go for a wonder outside the walls
-builders just straight up ignoring buildings during day time
-those berries bushes that never spawn even when all tress are cleared and plenty of space
- And not to forget the bloody ghost that keeps coming back to haunt me
I don't know if this is a bug but the first time i saw the floaters it spawned 26 of them. 26!!
and since I've been getting maybe 30 every blood moon? are we meant to be able to combat this?! they don't die easy guys. started around island 2/3 i think.

But the lack of new content between this and the last game that could've fit in one update/dlc kinda hurts as i had big expectations for this game. The incredible amount of bugs that have been added with this extra content is ridiculous. 

Otherwise and I can't stress this enough I am not trying to discourage the devs the game has the most beautiful graphics I've seen in most games. The player interaction/ UI is incredibly simple and smart. the level design and just general animations are incredibly well done. It can be improved and expanded and the devs may decide to do so still. I wish you guys have the best luck squashing these bugs or flaws or whatever they are and keep this game growing.

Sadly for now I will not recommend the game. But I will be back to review the game at later date in hopes of it improving.

good game.,True,1592159051
"Pros:
 - Beautiful world and gorgeous pixel graphics. 
 - Real sense of exploration and discovery.
 - The game tries as far as possible to be a game without UI or text, and succeeds to a surprisingly large extent. Worth playing just for the sheer originality in implementation. 
 - More content than you would expect: I still discovered new things on the fourth play-through 
 - Really makes you FEEL like a Kingdom Two Crowns. 
 - Overall, actually quite fun and enjoyable. 
 - Very satisfying to get back at the Gnoblins (i.e., The Greed) and show them What For! 

Cons:
 - Multiplayer is really buggy: save and exit, then rejoin, player 2 has lost all inventory (including GEMS!), go to next island, player 2 has lost all inventory (INCLUDING GEMS!!!). Also other multiplayer bugs. 
 - It can be very obscure sometimes - the Wiki helps. But you can easily make permanent mistakes like chopping down the wrong trees which eliminates your vagrant camps too early. What the heck does this do? 
 - No way to cancel an order after you've made it (chopped down the wrong tree, too bad! Workers heading out after dark and being slayed by knoblins (i.e., the Greed), TOO BAD! Committed all your troops to inner towers and have nothing to man the outskirts of your base? Whoopsie! Guess they're there permanently!)  
 - Banker is hard to bank with: when you drop the coins, sometimes the farmers, workers, or archers kind of steal it from you, and sometimes he gives you money back when you're trying to bank it. A bit hard to explain, but you'll definitely see when you play it. 
 - WHY THE HECK CAN'T I JUST BANK GEMS WITH THE MYSTERIOUS CLOAKED FIGURE WITHOUT UPGRADING THE BASE?! The price in gold is enough to dissuade you in the beginning, and having to try to skip over the chests every time to leave them there so the Noblins can't steal them permanently is just annoying!  
 - Very questionable game choices: such as winter, where you can do almost nothing. Honestly, game would be improved 100% with removal or improvement of winter. It's SO boring. 

Overall, really great game game! Original, fun, and a truly beautiful aesthetic with minimal UI to distract you. Single player is mostly great with a few hiccoughs. Multiplayer is a little more buggy but still worth playing. Would definitely recommend, 7/10.",True,1592103051

I feel like Kingdom Two Crowns added more which was very welcomed, but didn't fix the most frustrating and boring parts of the game.

Winter is just not fun. You are going strong, building a kingdom, fighting back the horde and trying to not die while expanding your domain... and then winter hits. And you just sit there. Doing nothing. Nothing is happening. At that point you aren't even really playing the game.

There isn't as much music as I like as well, a lot of the time it is just dead silent which is disappointing because they have some great tracks just wish I could hear them more and for longer.

All in all, a pretty simple but fun and relaxing game is made frustrating by Winter mechanics that at the worst screw you over so hard you start over, or at best leave you sitting there doing nothing at all wishing that you didn't have to wait hours of ""gameplay"" for winter to end so you can go back to doing... anything at all.",False,1591672699

"[b]This is my personal opinion and should not discourage anyone from buying this game if they so desire.[/b]

Kingdom Two Crowns is a side-scrolling build and defence game that has survival inspired themes into the mix. You play as a monarch (king or queen) that aims to reclaim lost lands, or start a new kingdom from scratch, take it however you will. The game, to me, has outstanding pixel art in many areas. Some areas though, not so much [spoiler]*Cough* the Horse *Cough*[/spoiler]. Here are some points that I think are good:

1. [b]Artstyle, World building, Visual design and Sound design[/b]. Like I said before, the game has some great visuals. From the dense trees that dissapear as you cut trees to the water that is always following you on the bottom of the screen. The streams of running water that dribble appealingly with the games fantastic music and sound design (in my opinion). The background scenery displays the world building sufficiently as mountains and other momuments clads the view neatly so you don't miss it. A lot of love was given to the visual appeal to the game, and I applaud them for it in return.

[b]The Core Idea[/b]. The core idea of the game is solid. The foundation is essentually gather money, spend on new villagers and upgrade. Gather Gems which are essentially the win-condition of the game. Because without them, I don't see how you're going to win. You need them to unlock statues, new mounts, extra workers that indroduces new workshops etc. You pouch can only hold a certain amount of cash too, so you will need to spend the cash you get and find ways to store the gems you get too. There are many ways to earn money from exploration chance (which is very limited), farming (which is 100% the best), hunting, banking, fishing and more. You need to build solid defences as you will be attacked every evening (if it doesn't bug that is. We'll get to that later) by greedy spongebobs. This game and New Kingdoms introduced new islands which also added the boat, which after building completion takes you to a new island with new possibilities. That is a brilliant design as it makes you wanna continue playing and see what's next. That also introduced the Decay of settlements which made it valuable to return to new settlements to spend gems and rebuild.

3.[b]Minor bonus details[/b]. I like the fact that once you lose, you roll a new character with a new color scheme and gender. Really adds to the mix of ""ooh, what will it be this time?"" kind of feel. 

Now, [b]Mixed[/b] opinions:

[b]The Winter[/b]. Winter is what I am going to pass on as mixed. As someone who has played a large amount of Endless Legend, by far my most favorite Civlike, Winter is an important part of the games setting and gameplay as it affects everyone in a negative way. So, what does winter do here? Hamper everything to a crawl. It does 1 single thing, ruin you. Which is good and a bad thing I guess. Winter could be a dealbreaker for you, as it was for me. I will explain further why Winter is so bad, as there's more to it than just Winter's design. All farms die, animals are gone, your base economy essentially plummitts. But, it's not impossible to beat it. You can with careful planning and experience deal with winter. New player? pff, you're screwed.

And now, off to [b]the Bad[/b]. Hold on tight, I will be attacked by religious fans of this game.

[b]You will be FORCED to google.[/b] Ok, I can't hold onto it anymore. The game essentially tells you nothing. It forces you to google for answers the game refuses to tell you. The game expects way too much for new players and you're often left like ""Ok, what does this do? Should I spend my coin and gems on this?"". Many times, I lost hours and even days of a game because I spent money on what shouldn't be spent on. The only type of tutorial you have is the ghosty thing following you occassionally, which barely even works as a tutor. I had to work out on my own what the heck the banker actually does, because the game couldn't be bothered to help you with it. And in there, the fanbase essentually attacks you from asking what things to and question why the game didn't teach you to begin with. ""Self learning"" and ""learn from experience"" they said. Aweful design is what I call it. A game that cannot teach new players on how to play is essentially just being a nuisance to its playerbase. You are going to have to have to Wiki on how to survive Winter, I guarentee you.

[b]Construction block and other nuisances[/b]. There seems to be a lot of mechanics in this game that is passed off as ""game design mechanics"" rather than bugs. For example, you're telling me that it was intended that spending money of cutting off trees that happened to be in a certain close distance to a portal should steal your money? Like, wtf? Seriously? And people even DEFEND this. There are many obvious design flaws that are passed off as intended game design here, because the rabid fanbase says so.

[b]Minor bugs and visual glitches[/b]. A popular criticism with this game are bugs. Luckly, I seem to have been on the safe end of the firing line. I only got visual glitches like my money and gems falling from the sky for some reason and My Griffon looking like an overexposed photoshop project in nearby lightsources. (uploaded a pic on profile). The multiplayer apparently used to be pretty bad, but I have none to play multiplayer with on this game so I am 100% single player.

Overall, I say the game is decent. It's actually great in what it does, but aweful in actually being a decent game at times. It's a marvel in pixel art design at times, but a fat nuisance and a slap to the face when it comes to game design. Was I too harsh? Tell me in the comments below or just bash me from speaking my opinion on a game I spent money on. Cheers!",True,1591530993

Kingdom Two Crowns is an elegant game with the perfect blend of relaxing, strategic, and at times stressful. 
With very little written explanation provided, discovering the new buildings and characters throughout the game is an intuitive and truly rewarding experience.

"He jugado este juego con mi novia de relax y es de los mejores juegos para jugar en pareja o con un amig@. Por suerte venía del castigador juego original (un solo jugador) así que ya sabía qué esperarme en cuanto a cómo jugarlo, porque realmente no te enseñan nada salvo dos cosas básicas al inicio. Igualmente, este es mucho menos castigador, en especial al jugar dos personas, perderás y cometerás errores, pero mantienes la mayoría de progreso. Es muy adictivo y siempre que jugamos suelen ser sesiones muy largas de lo divertido que es aguantar días y noches, al mismo tiempo que ves tu Reino crecer y progresar sobreviviendo/atacando los enemigos. Disfrútalo y descúbrelo en compañía. Tiene un estilo de supervivencia similar a Don't Starve Together pero con mecánicas muy diferentes e innovadoras como el hecho de ser puro scroll lateral.

Importante mencionar que es el juego pixel art más bonito que he jugado jamás, y la banda sonora es también muy bonita. Todas las expansiones y actualizaciones han sido gratuitas, así que ese es otro grandísimo extra a favor del estudio y de esta ""saga"".

La única pega que le veo, a parte de pequeños detalles jugables que son un poco toscos (que tienes que aprender y adaptarte), es el hecho de que este no es tan rejugable como el original, pero sí tiene más contenido y es más interesante. No sé si es porque ya le dediqué muchas horas al primero y aquí veo un poco ""más de lo mismo"", pero este es más en plan ""campaña"" con niveles random y tal pero eso, mientras que el original era siempre el mismo nivel con creación aleatoria con el único objetivo de sobrevivir. Igualmente, quieras o no rejugarlo para superar todo de nuevo, tendrás sí o sí bastantes horas de juego aseguradas.

"Read my full-length review here: https://saveorquit.com/2020/05/31/review-kingdom-two-crowns-dead-lands/

Kingdom is a franchise I both love and hate.  On the one hand, it has a simple elegance of design, maximizing the depth while minimizing the complexity of the gameplay.  (That said, in their quest to keep expanding the game, it has inevitably suffered from some bloat compromising the game.) On the other hand, it also has a pathological aversion to telling you all but the most rudimentary elements of how the game works.  Survival requires careful planning and management of time, but what you have to plan around isn't described [i]at all[/i] in the game, nor are what benefits you get from a random thing you find in the woods that demands gems to activate described until after you irrevocably spend gems upon it.  If you aren't going to just read the wiki in its entirety before playing, expect to spend dozens of hours of gameplay time resetting because you were screwed by some gotcha nonsense the game did nothing to communicate to the player, which is [i]immensely[/i] frustrating.

The game doesn't feel so much difficult at times as just plain unfair because basic mechanics have zero explanation.  For example, I had to play the game multiple times to understand what that weird box or weird old lady that appears does (it's a bank for gems), and had to just carry gems that took up valuable coin space for lack of understanding this.  

With all that complaining out of the way, it may sound strange to say this about a pixel graphics game, but this game is gorgeous, and creates an atmosphere far more evocative than most AAA games that spend tens of thousands of times the budget of this game purely on graphics.  The music, in addition, is positively haunting at times.  When I'm seeing the moon rise, and hearing a tense song start to play, and looking out at a field where no greedlings lurk, I start to freak out in spite of myself wondering just where they are... it's not a blood moon, they aren't all on the other side of the kingdom destroying my defenses... right?

The new (at the time of writing this) Dead Lands expansion is of course a Bloodstained crossover.  I honestly can't say how much overlap in potential playerbase there is here, since the games are alike in tone but drastically different in gameplay.  So far as Kingdom goes, Miriam's ability to freeze enemies is a vast improvement on the other mode monarch's ability to do nothing but get mobbed by greedlings.  That said, the mount selection in Dead Lands is worse.  Igivania's little bite attack and being able to eat anywhere in no way justifies having a run speed slower than other mounts' walk speed.

In all, I definitely think that this game does enough things differently from everyone else that it's definitely worth just playing to see how it re-imagines gameplay outside traditional genre lines.  I would certainly think this game better if they tried to make it more beginner-friendly rather than relying upon not telling people the rules to screw them over their first few playthroughs, but there's enough here to love to get past the early frustrations.",True,1590960363

However, I will say if your whole marketing of the game is based on playing as co-op, maybe you should have fixed those bugs before releasing as it was the downfall of the game in the beginning. 
I mean fix everything before releasing in general but you should have done more because now everyone is left with ""It's been 2 years and things still are not getting fixed.""

"This game is one of the most original and Unique games that exists
which makes this even more sad that its an unplayable buggy mess

Years ago me and my sister played through this game and overlooked all the bugs until a gamebreaking bug made it so we couldn't progress any further (it was pretty much the same experience as now, where lots of good fun moments mixed in with tedious bug tolerance moments, and every bug was somehow different then the last)

Then, we decided to give it a shot now because of the new DLC with new fun mechanics, but all that did was add more unique bugs, and its always a different bug 

some things that happened this time

- Gave coins to unlock new character but the new character bugged out and didn't switch like it did with the other 3 characters, we then couldn't be the new character until we beat the entire island for no reason???

- random gamebreaking bug where some islands blood moons just didnt send any attacks so we could take it over really fast with no consequences

-EVERY SINGLE TIME we load a new map it kicks out me because i am not the host, and i have to re-enter the game

-Random NEW bug where because i am not host whenever i re-enter, or we go to a new map, or i go inside of the enemy cave for the bomb part, all my coins reset to 0 for no reason, which was not what it was like before 

-Somehow we ended up duping a TON of diamonds on accident because we got hit by greed with them and then tackled them with horse and it just ended up making more diamonds then we even know what to do with

-we accidentally took out the tent on the first island before clearing it which made it super tedious and unfun to go and fix it by going to another island we have cleared to bring troops back to the first island (which we didnt even manage to do because the boat did the next bug on this list while we were trying to do it)  

- The bug THIS time that made us stop playing was we went to an already cleared island and the boat bugged out and stayed beside the lighthouse and no matter what we do we cant get it to sail to any more islands , we tried the bell, we tried going near the boat beside the lighthouse, nothing makes it work. So AGAIN we havent full cleared this game because a game breaking bug made it impossible to progress, 2+ years later

"The game has or rather I should say had potential, but it's been two years since release and I'm experiencing and reading about bugs that were present since release and in some cases carried over from the previous game.

Playing co-op is an exercise in frustration, when it works it's fun; emphasis on **when**.

Between two cabled PCs, Gigabit synchronous online fibre connection the game still somehow manages to constantly disconnect and/or lag. When you've disconnected you can try reconnecting to your friend either directly or by getting invited over 20 times, it'll never succesfully reconnect again. You have to both exit the game, pray for the planets to align and maybe it'll let you connect to eachother again, often it'll require multiple attemps coupled with restarts of the game.

The game will bug out in literally every session I've played in a variety of ways. Sometimes the day/night cycle will just stop working and you'll be stuck in a neverending night, your only clue on whether it's actually night are the torches on objects being lit.

Your coop partner's mount may look like a different one than the one they're actually using, the mount may appears to be riding backwards.

Builders won't build, they'll run back and fort hammering a building once every 10 seconds, screwing you over especially when you're upgrading walls.

The villager AI is all over the place, aside from idling seemingly at random sometimes *all* workers will walk into one direction of your island, even if only one or two are needed. Staggering repairs/upgrades on the other side as a result.

Other units like knights will randomly decide to run in like Leeroy Jenkins when attacking a dock portal resulting in their demise, while other times they'll stand at the appropriate distance in completely safety.

Achievement don't unlock in coop when they should often requiring multiple attempts.

At least the game's pixel art is gorgeous and the soundtrack is 'okay'. But I can't recommend this as at all for an enjoyable co-op experience. Maybe the game has less issues solo...

"Even though I like the game I did Almost completed whole game, with the achievement ""There is not greater ruler than thou"" where all caves are destroyed while with one monarcy. Lets say that I was not pleased when my last island (in my case number 3) where last cave was still active, I don't know why, but for some f**ed up reason, my Queen died even though I managed to get out the cave within 14seconds.... really disappointing bug. In none other island did I have any trouble getting out in time.

IMHO I would remove this whole ""must be fast out of cave"" nonsense, especially when fastest mount in the game can't even get out within time. If I use Dracula, game crashes when getting out and when loggin back in my crown has been destroyed...

However, the multiplayer aspect is very glitchy. I play with my husband and the game works okay for about an hour and then random disconnects happen, the second player loses gold when going to a new island, assets don't load in or move after some gameplay in any island after stone is unlocked, severe lagging after defeating portals, and the second player cannot buy a crown for the first player if lost.

"One of my favorite games of all time.

It may not be for everyone, but I found it to be simultaneously addictive, relaxing, intriguing, mysterious, soothing, terrifying, nerve-wracking, frustrating, arcane, intensely satisfying, and absolutely beautiful.

I had trouble describing this game to my friends at first -- initially I called it a tower defense game because that seemed to be a core mechanic.  You do build towers and defend waves of the 'greed' at night -- those nightmarish little green things that come to tear your walls down and steal your crown.  Another term I've heard used is 'micro-strategy', which I suppose is accurate, but what the heck even is that, right?  'Management' doesn't quite capture it.  My friends have peeked at me playing, saw my monarch running from left to right across the level, dropping coins, and asked: ""But what do you actually DO?""

Describing it may not do it justice, but since this is one of my favorite series of all times, here goes WITH A WARNING:

When I described the game as enigmatic, I meant that part of the appeal is figuring out the mechanics of the game, what things mean, what to do/not do... it's very rewarding and satisfying to uncover new secrets and features within.  So, at your own risk, how does one actually PLAY Kingdom?

PROTECT THE CROWN AT ALL COSTS.  You are a lone monarch on a trusty steed.  You have no 'powers' at the offset, but you have a coin purse and the legitimacy of your rule!  Build a campfire in the middle of the level with your starting gold. 
 Convert hobos into serfs by dropping coin on them.  Purchase tools in your town, and your new subjects will show their gratitude by picking them up and working for you.  You can explore the woods outside of your town in hopes of finding a chest of gold, but primarily your peasants will act on their own.  You don't control them -- they run around and do what they can during the day, and usually make it back inside by nightfall.  Those that picked up bows will wander around to hunt animals, collecting money for you in the process.  Those you buy hammers for will be the ones to actually build the walls you pay for, and repair them in the morning... after ""The Greed"" attacks....

The main enemy of the game is called Greed, an on the nose name for an adversary that punishes hasty expansion.  While these personifications of avarice pop out of portals at night to bust your town up. But if you try to extend your walls out too fast too soon, or if you get too eager and try to upgrade an outer wall at night... you will pay the consequences.

So, you make decisions.  You explore.  Eventually, you have options besides ""Build. Expand. Defend."" but if you have been intrigued by this so far, I'd recommend just picking the game up!  It's way more interesting and rewarding to discover the game's secrets yourself.",True,1589163781

"Bought the game a week ago (after seeing VODs of people playing it for a few hours) and have sunk 40 hours into it thus far; it's definitely a good treat if you enjoy building something up bit by bit until you finally feel safe:ish, even when night draws near. Definitely enjoy and recommend the game despite its flaws, especially if you play it co-op.

That said, if you want to play this game well you better be patient: a lot of the game mechanics are unclear, unintuitive and even frustrating. 1/4 to 1/3 of the time to gain ""become good"" at this game is probably figuring out how to out-maneuver the yanky game mechanics and the AI that's programmed to be slightly insane.

Then there are the bugs, several of which just add to the frustration of playing this game for an extended period. Have had many things happen such as graphical bugs where blown-out caves have still had their purple portal, building an Iron tower with Stone technology because the hermit helping me build a Ballista jumped off, and most infuriatingly have things become unrecoverable even after rousing the enemy from the island where they took them.

The game is pretty, which has it's own downfalls: playing the game on a non-""gaming laptop"" (which I am) just ramps up the GPU and fan massively. The game runs smoothly but gets Loud and Warm. There are No graphics options in this game, which is a shame as that would've been a good way to solve this issue because I'm pretty sure that it would be resolved if there was a way to turn off the pretty, dynamically rendered river at the bottom part of the screen - it doesn't have any real purpose except looking pretty.

Not sure how long it'll take before getting tired enough of all the flaws with this game that I'll stop playing it (from what other reviewers have said it seems that bug-fixing isn't really on the table...) but hopefully Shogun and Dead Lands will keep it alive for me for at least a couple hundred hours total.",True,1589107647

"Played this on Xbox One via Game Pass and had a blast playing couch co-op. Seemed to work flawlessly there. It pretty much plays exactly like Kingdom New Lands, just with added co-op and new themes (Shogun first, then Bloodstained recently) though I can't recommend the Shogun, since the Pikemen are clearly superior to the ninja ambushes, at least when I last played Shogun about a year and a half ago. Both of the additional themes are free updates to the base game.

This game is about as peaceful AND stressful as Minecraft or Terraria. Maybe you didn't plan ahead and you've spent your last gold during the winter and forgot to prepare. Perhaps you've destroyed a portal and forced a blood moon, and you've got large, shielded enemies approaching that are rapidly spawning more smaller enemies. Maybe you had planned on spending only 30 minutes or so in the game to pass the time and you've now just noticed 6 hours have passed you by. During the daytime, you can wander around collecting gold, ordering workers to chop down trees and build/fortify walls and structures. During the nighttime, you are bombarded from either or both sides of the map at the same time. Playing solo will have you running back and forth each day, gathering resources and finding more vagrants in the wilderness to hire, and planning for the main goal of the game: Progress far enough to unlock The Bomb, and then lead a team of your knights and workers into the Cave Portal on each island, set The Bomb to blow, and run the heck out as fast as you can.

This game is a rogue-lite, where you will eventually be overrun by enemies while you're pants are down and you'll have no choice but to drop the crown and start over. Aside from destroying the big Cave Portals, short-term goals can include destroying the Dock Portal, or simply rebuilding your boat and moving to a different island. Expect to get completely destroyed each time you destroy a smaller portal after the third island. Some upgrades you unlock (stone/iron/playable-Bloodstained-characters) will still be readily available to you on each reign, but others (shrines/mounts) can still be reacquired via gold if you've already paid the gem cost previously. The game will get more difficult as time days and weeks go by, so it can sometimes be in your best interest to lose the crown and start back from the first island, learning from your failure and coming up with a new strategy.

Having played Kingdom New Lands before, I haven't noticed anything particularly game-breaking. The pause screen can be wonky, as the game will think that when you pressed up on the gamepad to change your menu selection, you clearly wanted to use your special action, so the game will use your special action right after you've left the pause screen. Using the ninjas in the Shogun theme was very underwhelming. They died almost as soon as they attacked enemies and - what's worse - they replace the Pike men from the vanilla/Bloodstained themes and cost more to recruit them. Allegedly, they have been adjusted since I last used them, and will even fish up gold coins for you during the daytime, or so the patch notes would have me believe.

As for co-op: I can honestly say that co-op has been a blast. I have not played with the so-called janky online co-op. My experience has been in splitscreen couch co-op and it sounds like that is clearly the way to go if the online mode is as bad as people have been describing it. With that in mind as well as the current global situation (if you know what I mean), for the Steam version, perhaps you may want to make use of the new Steam Remote Play Together options available to you, should your internet connections be up for the task. Playing in co-op brings about new strategies you can try out with a friend. Rather than running around from one end of the map to the other, you can divide and conquer! Split up and watch the defense of both ends of your kingdom. Your friend lose their crown? You can buy them a new one for about 8 gold, or don't because they need to learn a valuable lesson.

Any game which introduces a feature which, in effect, directs you to just leave it running on your computer for two hours with you contributing nothing towards it, while it runs a simulation, doesn't deserve a recommendation.

Specifically, here, I'm referring to ""winter"" which is such a pointless season in the game that all I could do was leave the computer running and walk away.

"Kingdom Two Crowns is a pixelated side scrolling adventure where you control your character using just your arrow keys. The game seems simple enough. You are a king or queen who must rebuild your kingdom. You do this by collecting coins and strategically make smart choices with what you buy them with. This can range from weapons, buildings, defenses, or recruiting villagers from the woods. As night comes, creatures from portals arrive trying to attack your kingdom. This happens once a day, but when daybreak arrives you are free to roam outside your kingdom safely. Every day the chances of the creatures becoming stronger increases so you cannot simply stay on one island.
Once you have built your kingdom to your satisfaction, then you are able to use your coins to rebuild a ship which is used to travel to another map. 

A lot of this game requires patience and strategy as you progress. The game restarts at a certain point when the king/queen you control is attacked by a monster and loses the crown. A new heir will emerge and continue your legacy as you try to rebuild your progress.

I have played Kingdom: Classic, Kingdom: New Lands, and now Kingdom Two Crowns. This is a pretty good franchise to get into. The soundtrack for this game is just beautiful., very calm, peaceful, and serene. The pixel animation of the game is fascinating. I have never played another game like this series.

"I have put a few hours into the game now and I have enjoyed it quite a bit. It has a nice feel to it, it is simplistic using 4 buttons and the music is easy on the ears. I went through the shogun samurai game. It is super tedious but once you get going it gets really addicting. At times I found myself losing track of time. The thing that bothered me the most is the AI for the villagers is just ridiculous, I would find myself getting upset with them because they were out chopping wood when night hit, I tried to run my lizard out and stop some of the horde coming but they took my builders and got my dog cause I wanted to play hero. It would be nice if there was some lore or something to read in the game, maybe explaining the areas, enemies, mounts. I feel like that would be a nice touch. Over all I personally enjoyed the game. I see people down voting it to issues that existed at launch, if that's true that is just lazy development. I haven't played coop with anyone so I never experienced those issues personally but I was able to make it to the end without experiencing anything game breaking in single player.

"This is a terrible game if you want to play it in coop.

SP might be okay but do NOT buy this if you want to play it with a friend.
As soon as you start playing it online it gets the most horrible bugs with desync, rubberbanding, random game elements stopping to work.

EG:
1) We attacked a portal and the soldiers went to stand in front of the enemy spawning portal and just stopped doing anything, no attacks no retreat nothing

2) One of us felled trees and the forest despawned on one players side not on the others, leaving one of us unable to build anything on the stil ""forested"" building spots

3) Buildings randomly went uninteractable on one players client while the other could use them fine

4) Greed went invisible on one players client.

While all these bugs can be worked around by restarting the game, having to restart a game every 5-10 minutes just to play with a friend is unacceptable.

As you can see by my playtime we tried liking the game because the idea is enjoyable, but seeing us being coop players and having been promised so often that the MP bugs were fixed just to run into them straight again, I can not, in good conscience, recommend the game for MP purposes",False,1588513384
"One of the most beautiful and addictive games I've played. Worth every single pound from my bank account.
The artwork is beautiful. The game is really entertaining and challenging. There is a lot of content to explore. I've played Kingdom Classic, Kingdom New Lands and now Kingdom Two Crowns. You can clearly see how the game developed, how much content and love they put into the game! Worth it! 10/10",True,1588494912
"A great continuation of the series. A lot of new features have been added in addition to expanding on old mechanics in the game. This game is so simple and yet I keep coming back to this series and enjoy every moment of it. It's a good game to relax with. Early on I know a lot of people were talking about bugs with the game (a lot of them, apparently), so I held off getting the game for a good while. It seems, however, that most of those bugs have been quashed. The only issue I've run into so far is villagers wiggling back and forth sometimes in front of the castle when going to get a bow. They always get unstuck, however, so it hasn't made the game unplayable.",True,1588481794

Desyncs causing friend to not be able to interact with buildings. Outright disconnecting friend at launch if they are not quick enough to accept the invite.

"Si ya jugaron Kingdom: New Lands, en 6 horas que llevo de juego de capaña, básicamente es lo mismo, solo que con la IA mejorada (las unidades dejan de hacer actividades fuera de las murallas cuando se acerca la noche y se resguardan), algunas monturas nuevas (el grifo hace el desplazamiento muy fluido), una unidad nueva (lancero, que es muy imbécil). De hecho al mejorar la IA el juego se ha vuelto bastante más sencillo para sobrevivir las olas de enemigos y poder ir a otras islas, que hasta el momento se mantienen exactamente iguales que en su ""predecesor"".

No he jugado las expansiones, así que no hablaré de ellas por el momento, y tampoco he tocado el online que es el mayor cambio que se nota a primera vista.

"[h1]For being a game where half the time played seems to be spent waiting for things to happen, Kingdom is very fun.[/h1]

 However a few questionable additions to the game are thrown in to potentially ruin the players kingdom instantly if they make the wrong choice, which is hard to know when you never know what you're paying for when trying something new.

[h1]What do I mean by that? (SPOILERS AHEAD)[/h1]

 Well, the perfect example is the Knight Statue. What's the Knight Statue? Well, you find statues on the islands, and by paying with gems (a currency that can't ever be renewed after spent in your save file) you can activate the statue by paying again with coins. The first three statues you find are great, and I won't spoil what they do because they're fun to discover for yourself. The Knight Statue is different. You find it last, and since it appears to affect Knights because it looks like one, it deceives you into thinking it must be a really good statue- it was saved for last, it must make the knights amazing!!

[h1]It doesn't.[/h1]

 Not only does the statue not make the knights better, it makes them suicide-leap in the enemy every night, meaning for the rest of your current life (because only by death will the statue deactivate) all of your knights will die every night. This is just one example of how playing the game without web searching for what new things do will result in you potentially wanting to just run your character out to lose so you can start over. There are several other issues just like this one, and the rest of this review is just going to be a laundry list of problems with the game, with no description, just for showing the raw quantity of them;
[list]
[*]Getting stuck on a slow/low stamina mount without having unlocked mount switching.
[*]AFKing in winter because you didn't prepare to have no income besides banker/spears/ninjas.
[*]The bomb doesn't light automatically even though there's nothing else to do at that point.
[*]The game allows you to buy the bomb before clearing all small portals.
[*]Knights commit suicide by dock portal.
[*]The lighthouse is actually kind of pointless.
[*][b]The Shogun expansion shouldn't be called the Shogun expansion, because the Shoguns weren't Monarchs. What do I mean? The Shogunate in Japan was a dictatorship where rule was gotten by force, while the emperor still existed but didn't rule. Therefore, if I'm the ""Monarch"" (King/Queen as called by my subjects in the intro) I'm not a Shogun, and I shouldn't be ruling the Shogunate.[/b]
[*]The Shogun reskin changes pikemen into ninjas, but the Dead Lands reskin just has regular pikemen again??
[*]Dead Lands has Shogun sound effects when upgrading town center, but doesn't have ninjas???
[*]Where did the f#$%ing ninjas go????
[*]Every mount that isn't fast/high stamina sucks because you can never reach the edges of your kingdom/scout with a slow mount.
[*]The bad mounts bait you into thinking they might be cool, like the lizard unlock area looks like the mount will be amazing, then it totally sucks??? WHY????
[*]The gem chest costs a gem to unlock and isn't clear in what it will do if you pay more gems.
[*]Winter is boring even if you are making money during winter.
[*]The seasons changing is nice visually but it barely affects anything.
[*]The catapult is a great way to destroy your own base by giving the enemy giants ammo to AoE your soldiers.
[*]Why is buying the catapult a way to upgrade the ENEMY army???
[*]Why can't the pikemen stab upwards to hit the flying enemies?? Or the JUMPING enemies???
[*]I read that the pikemen can stab upwards but I have played 30 hours and NEVER seen them do that.
[*]Towers are a great way to waste coins.
[*]If you build enough towers early on, you can softlock yourself by running out of archers because they are all stuck in the towers.
[*]The only good hermit is the baker, unless you get really lategame and need the ballista but you might as well just buy more archers.
[*]The Dracula guy with the ability to turn into a bat should have been in the base game.
[*]The Dracula guy should recharge his power faster.
[*]Miriam, Zangetsu and the old guy should also be able to turn into bats, because their powers suck and are useless anyway.
[*]Maybe the Dracula guy should be able to bite their necks and turn them into vampires too?
[*][b]Final item of this list; the Dracula guy should be able to bite everyone's neck in the whole Kingdom, so they can all move really fast by turning into bats.[/b]

"Nowhere in the game does it present difficulty if there is no Blood Moon so you can even let the game play by itself and when there is a Blood Moon one of your friends has a lizard mount that spits a mystical fire that kills in seconds. As long as you have this lizard playing the game is like walking in the park.
In the winter you can only collect berries so the money never runs out. You get a minimal challenge on the last island if you destroy every portal, but of course when you go to the last island you have all the troops and upgrades in addition to the lizard, so that doesn’t end up being a problem either.
If the blood moon that was caused by the destruction of the portal (Which is also easy) is not counted, I only got a random blood moon once.
Also, challenge maps are SP only for some reason.

I used to enjoy the older games in the series, but this latest game feels boring. Also lots of bugs but that is a small thing and wont affect much.",False,1588436909

"As much as id like to recommend this game it has flaws that haven't been fixed for years. Sometimes theyse flaws make the game impossible to progress. Glitchy mobs that get stuck in the woods and characters that get stuck outside the walls and coins that don't appear on the UI when spending them and the last time i played the soldiers wouldn't load the boat unless i restarted the game. I have lost my crown to invisible mobs and have been forced to restart the game.

Altogether since this game is so small and easy to load it's not ""the worst thing in the world"" but i can't understand how they can release content updates that don't address any of the issues that were present before it. These problems weren't present in the two previous games.

Great game but the lack of attention to the most basic of issues is frustrating.

Updated review

GordonVanDyke - listed as a developer

""If only it was that simple; we've been replacing lots of systems and issues out of our control have required additional work. To update our game we also need to chase Unity (our game engine) updates that add new issues. Without these updates we can't release on all platforms. It's a relentless race that we look at as a marathon and not a sprint. And while Kingdom Two Crowns has a simple facade it is by no means a simple game. The backend and systems are surprisingly complex. I don't write this as an excuse, but as a means to help you understand the challenges faced when making any game of this complexity. We will continue to fix these issues and try to provide interesting new content. Hope this message helps, even if only just a little. <3""

I hoped for a better answer than this. Simply ""were working hard to fix the issue"" would have been enough for me however as i read the response that has been given me i have taken away from it that you are saying ""this is harder than you think"" and by allowing the bugs to remain in the game that at times has been unplayable just so you may reach new platforms leaves me hoping that a quest for money has not been the sole reason you would sell a cheaper product than the quality products i have purchased before from this developer in the past.",False,1588430260
"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",True,1588411614
"I bought this game on a whim in the middle of the week and I've already sunk 28 hours into it and started and restarted and re-restarted over and over again. This game is absolutely gorgeous, and the soundtrack is breathtaking - this is the only game with an available soundtrack that I fully intend on purchasing. It's composed so carefully, perfectly matching my queen as she sprints from the safety of the walls immediately after a greedling attack to go and recruit more peasants at the far edges of the map. 

It's delightfully challenging; frustrating as it is to make it to a new island only to find that, oh, crap, I didn't upgrade my walls quickly enough and now I'm out of money and everyone is gone, it's also fine because I've actually learned something. I know how to plan for my next run through. This game makes me think and sucks away my hours. It's currently two in the morning and I swear it was just seven pm. 

I'm addicted. I can't wait to play through all the DLC and experience the game from a different perspective. 2D platformers haven't ever been my thing, but this satisfies my desire for tower defense and upgrading to bigger, fancier things. Please, do yourself a favour and check this game out.

Beware, though: sometimes, you notice things may get stuck? Save and quit, then reload the game. I had to do this twice when winter got stuck, but eventually it worked. I've also had to do this occasionally to trigger the option to build a new wall on a mound or a new archer tower on a rock. It's not a deal breaker for me in the slightest, but I feel it was necessary to mention it.

"The game has or rather I should say had potential, but it's been two years since release and I'm experiencing and reading about bugs that were present since release and in some cases carried over from the previous game.

Playing co-op is an exercise in frustration, when it works it's fun; emphasis on **when**. 

Between two cabled PCs, Gigabit synchronous online fibre connection the game still somehow manages to constantly disconnect and/or lag. When you've disconnected you can try reconnecting to your friend either directly or by getting invited over 20 times, it'll never succesfully reconnect again. You have to both exit the game, pray for the planets to align and maybe it'll let you connect to eachother again, often it'll require multiple attemps coupled with restarts of the game.

The game will bug out in literally every session I've played in a variety of ways. Sometimes the day/night cycle will just stop working and you'll be stuck in a neverending night, your only clue on whether it's actually night are the torches on objects being lit. 

Your coop partner's mount may look like a different one than the one they're actually using, the mount may appears to be riding backwards. 

Builders won't build, they'll run back and fort hammering a building once every 10 seconds, screwing you over especially when you're upgrading walls. 

The villager AI is all over the place, aside from idling seemingly at random sometimes *all* workers will walk into one direction of your island, even if only one or two are needed. Staggering repairs/upgrades on the other side as a result. 

Other units like knights will randomly decide to run in like Leeroy Jenkins when attacking a dock portal resulting in their demise, while other times they'll stand at the appropriate distance in completely safety.

Achievement don't unlock in coop when they should often requiring multiple attempts.

"I do love this game, my partner and I have put plenty of hours into it and enjoyed every moment, so i do heartily recommend it...however, I do have some gripes, mostly with the development team and the decisions they have made (or not as is more often the case):

1/ Information:  the complete lack of information and communication form the dev team is irritating in the extreme, trying to find out any official information about the new dead lands expansion has been nigh on impossible, i have no idea what the new mounts or monarchs do, or what other changes have been made because there was no changelog with the update...this is just pure laziness on the devs part, I don't understand why you would go through all the effort of making this beautiful game and then not include any literature with it.  

2/ bugs...so many bugs, i encounter a different bug on almost every playthrough, and it's often the emergence of a game shattering bug that brings our gaming sessions to an end...it also doesn't help that bugs tend to snowball up on top of one another once one appears...for me this game was actually pretty stable on release and has gotten more and more buggy as it's been updated.

3/ options;  there are none.  For me this game is way too dark in places,  whenever i go into a thick forest i can't see anything, and i have my TV settings to maximum.  there are no options to adjust brightness or anything else like that, sorry but i actually like to be able to see the game i'm playing, especially when it's as pretty as this one is.

"If you buy this game, read a guide. Read another guide, and then watch someone else experienced play it first.

If you don't, you'll find the ingame tutorial is completely and utterly lacking. And then you will find out the few things it does tell you to do, will actually severely hamper your progress. You can utterly destroy your own progress permanently by walling in a farm to where it can't be used, upgrading buildings too much to upgrade them into a different path, destroying your only source of new people, or losing vital resources that can only be returned by defeating all the spawn points on a map- which could very well be impossible if you needed that resource.

In other words, you are the greatest danger to yourself, and while death in the game means you start over with some broken things but mostly keep your upgrades- it also means that any planning errors or destruction/lost resources will never be reset. Forcing you to make a hard decision of hating yourself while struggling forward, or simply cutting your losses and starting a new campaign.

When you think you start getting better at planning, you realize that your ai is generally decent, but not good enough to absolutely wreck itself at times. You'll see units suicide or make terrible decisions that you have no control over. And for the things you can trigger, you can't cancel. Accidentally tell someone to chop a tree rather than recruit a fellow and now you'll lose the ability to recruit forever more with that camp? Well tough luck. Build a wall in the wrong spot? Can't remove it. Same thing with another crucial building? Tough. Either deal with it or start over.

"This game could be fun, in theory. Unfortunately it is so filled with bugs or random features and really stupid AI that you spend most of your time and energy trying to bypass them. For example:
- Once you mark a tree for cutting down, no matter where it is, your ""workers"" go to this place at night, ignoring the danger, untill they're all dead. If you buy a hammer to replace them, guess what, the new worker just goes there again and dies. 
- If you have knights, the archers that accompany them and other archers will move EXTREMELY slowly to the next wall if you expand, but if you don't have knights, they will move faster (?). 
- Sometimes you just can't get a structure to spawn, especially forges. You can expand over the entire island on iron walls and nothing happens. Quitting and re-opening the game sometimes fixes it, sometimes not.
- Villagers cluster around the banker, sometimes making it almost impossible to give him money, as the villagers just collect the coins. You just can't help feeling stupid wasting your time trying to give the banker money.
- When you clear one side of the island (port side) you're left handicapped, as archers keep stacking at the safe side. Sometimes it's even worse, when you get attacked and lose most of the archers at the hill side and are left defenseless, despite having 2-3 knights and 20+ archers at the other side. There's no way to counter this, it's just frustrating.

I've been playing this with my wife but many playtime hours ago it just became a chore to finish it, as there are absolutely no new features after you first get to the 4th island and unlock the forge, the rest of the game is just boring.",False,1587331229

You can always keep making new saves to see if you can just get a little further without dying to the winter or dying in general. Don't do what I do though and keep making new saves when you die, sometimes it is good to just play it through till the end.

"Never have I ever beaten one of the Kingdom games. And it stands firm that it will stay that way because I keep making that stupid mistake of expanding a little too soon or too far and the greed knocks me back a few days worth of work. Regardless of that, the first time I dragged a bomb into the giant portal and blew the greed (and myself) to smithereens, it was well worth all the toil in previous games and the swearing at this one.

Rotational seasons, 2 different kingdoms with some unique units, a variety of mounts, and let's not forget co-op play (still have yet to play that mode). Kingdom: Two Crowns is a phenomenal addition to the series and is sure to take up a few dozen more hours of my time until I can finally slay the campaign, then go back and beat the previous two!

Oh, did I forget to mention they have challenge maps? Plague Island is ridiculous!

Thank you Arsenal.gg for the review key!",True,1586827782
"the game is really well made. It is genuinely challenging even though the loss does not impact you as much as one would expect but its still adding a number to your death count and that is no good. the gameplay is genuinely fun, unlike the other colony/kingdom survival games where you are generally given a top-down perspective, you play as an omnipotent being that tells everyone exactly what to do, unlike that this felt like a breath of fresh air. the game is rather simple on paper but once you get on the boat, man it opens up so much things
as I said the gameplay is good, and it is even further supported by the gorgeous pixel art and great music. the selection is small but it never really got me tired of it, so good job on that, Amos. Then their use of the effects makes every day feel at least somewhat unique, be it a foggy morning when you cannot even see the water, or a bright sunny day when even the ocean feels at peace
the addition of two player coop, being the main feature of this title, is even further reinforcing the core of the gameplay allowing two players focus on both sides or both players stand off a horde of monsters together. however, the lack of information from one player to the other without a voice chat in internet coop is somewhat crippling. I kinda wish the split screen remained even in multiplayer but I suppose that is up to preference

A bit too grindy if you played on your own for sure but with two people it's a lot more fun. Relies a lot on understanding mechanics such as gems/hermits etc without explaining it at all which is part of the fun in a sense however can also cause a lot of annoying resets and deaths and misunderstandings. Losing your gems permanently is also extremely annoying- we managed to win but it was a lot more difficult after not being able to acquire some of the stronger upgrades due to having lost too many gems.

"Pretty neat game. The gameplay mechanics are simple paired along with chill ass music and beautiful pixel graphics. The objective of the game is to get people into your kingdom, give them jobs to make gold coins or protect your kingdom, defend your kingdom against gapey purple monsters and to destroy said gapey purples monsters spawn cave by blowing it up with bombs and knights. There are a variety of different islands to travel back and forth from and each has their own unique mount and statues and hermits. That's pretty much it gameplay wise. There are a few spell buffs which statues or hermit npcs give you to help defend your kingdom or help you get more gold coins but that's about it. Even though it is a simple game nothing is really explained to you so here are some tips. There are seasons in the game so you really must remember to prepare for winter as there are no crops nor rabbits during winter. It would be highly inadvisable to go to a new island a few days before or during winter as you will be basically gold less and sooner or later be over-powered by gapey purple monsters. In order to combat the shortage of gold you should invest in the banker (you can get the banker by upgrading your town hall) which will add to the amount of money everyday. Or the other solution is pikemen. Lots and lots of pikemen. Pikemen hunt fish literally anywhere meaning they are a passive source of income indefinitely. If your gold satchel is overflowing and you see a chest you can sprint past it and it won't open. Most importantly archer towers. I cannot state the importance of archer towers. They may seem useless but man oh man are they vital when the new enemy type comes in. You'll see ;). Either than that I'd had a pretty fun experience although i did encounter some stuttered or freezing frames from time to time but it didn't really impact the experience that much. Overall I rate the game a solid 9/10. Pretty good replayability considering enemies get stronger and increase in horde numbers as the nights pass.",True,1585930939

It's really the bugs. Once my forge disappeared and there was no way to get it back. I built a wall beside it and the game took it as there was no more space for the forge and it disappeared and never came back. Another time all my builders kept running to the greed portal. Once a vagrant picked up a hammer it ran straight for the cliffside portal. I ran all the way there to see what they were trying to build but nothing. So all my builders constantly kept suiciding themselves into greed over and over again, making the game unplayable. Also, my ninjas don't work and don't fish.

"Such a fun game. Mixes both resource management and defense into a nice experience. A very easy game to get lost in while playing. Has many interesting things and the shogun add on is SO good all the little details like the trader being a wandering flute monk to the rabbits becoming tanooki really make that version of the game so much more interesting compared to the original. I can't even play the original look without thinking about how much more fun the shogun version is in comparison.
If you want a simple and still somehow complex game I would recommend to play this, just for the simple fact that it is easy to understand and hard to master.

"Atmospheric and deceptively simple, Kingdom is a game that will have you forget time. One more level syndrome shows strongly in the series, as one task leads smoothly into the next. In Two crowns, the addition of online multiplayer, remixed gameplay, meta progression, and challenge modes will keep you coming back for another day, another blood moon, another island, another campaign. The icing on top is the improved visual and sound quality; quite noticeable between Two Crowns and Classic. If you enjoy strategy management games, Kingdom: Two Crowns is easy to recommend.",True,1583869011
"I was hesitant to grab this game because reviews were kind of mixed. After playing it, I don't really see what the fuss was.

Still, I feel like I got my money's worth. A good game to play while chain-watching RedLetterMedia.

I will say I can't speak to the multiplayer experience, so perhaps some of the criticism came from that.",True,1583797195
It's okay.  I wish there was a neutral vote option.

"[h1]200 character summary[/h1]
Kingdom Two Crowns is the best Kingdom, It has everything from both previous games and a lot of extras like Multiplayer, cycling seasons, A new tech tier and a bomb to get rid of the greed for good.

[h1]Story & Characters [b]8/10[/b][/h1]
Kingdom like both previous games is set in a universe where the Greed tries to take the crown, You have to build your kingdom, hire peasants and give them tools to do tasks for you. That is the story, There is a tutorial ghost which only explains the mechanics, There are npcs who do stuff, but none of them talk, everyone is a mute here, Money talks. You can actually complete the game now, But there is not even a slideshow at the end, The first night will tell the story. I do think this fits the game nicely, A small slideshow at the end could be nice, but Story elements in the beginning or during the gmae will get annoying after the tenth time.

[h1]Gamemodes & Gameplay [b]8/10[/b][/h1]
In kingdom you are a pretty useless monarch on its own, Your only ability is riding your mount and dropping coins, But money is power, You must drop coins so the Vagrants pick one up and become peasants for your kingdom, Peasants will run towards your kingdom and pick up the first tool they see, You must buy these tools from the shops in your kingdom, Each tool makes a peasant a different class, A worker who can build carry and repair stuff, Archers who fire arrows, Farmers who earn money on farms, Pikemen who stab trough the walls and fish during the day, Squires who lead a group of archers and are used for attacking portals, Swords are upgrades for the Squires so they become Knights.

There are several upgrades on the different islands, There are mines that allow you to jump to the next technology age, Which allows you to further upgrade farms, Towers, Walls, etc. There are statues that allow you to upgrade a certain class of people, But also different mounts which have perks, Hermits which allow you to create specific structures and even a dog which will warn you if the greed is coming All these upgrades will remain as long as you keep your crown.

The game adds a lot of new stuff, You can play split screen, or online with a friend, Winter is not endless anymore, And there is actually a way to earn some money in this season, And there is also a bomb you can build to enter the portals and eliminate the greed on that island. The game has a bunch of challenge islands like Skull, Plague and Dire Island. These Challenge islands are in the old style, where losing the crown is the end, It are nice persistant challenges that allow you to set personal high scores especially Plague Island.

The biggest difference in the main campaign gameplay is the removal of permadeath, Which is a shame in my opinion. Surely we have a lot more content now, And I agree it is a shame if most people did not even saw 10% of that, But removing the permadeath removes the challenge. Once you die now you get a new monarch and start back on Island 1, everything will still be there, If you defeated the greed they will still be gone. There is a decay system and if you are not present on the island it will decay slowly, from outside in, Wall by wall, untill there is nothing left, but the greed will never come back once defeated.

[h1]Graphics & Soundtrack [b]9/10[/b][/h1]
The game looks like an improved version of the last 2 games, It added small details, A few different monarchs, You can also choose which biome you want to play in, currently we have Europe and Japan, But I heard more will be coming. 2 Crowns also has a huge soundtrack compared to the first game and especially compared to the second game, It is nice and fits the atmosphere, Some scenes look just magical.

[h1]Performance & Support [b]7/10[/b][/h1]
The performance is great, It does have a few bugs here and there, But they will be ironed out, I am missing some graphical settings like the ability to turn off vsync, I also notice small framedrops when there are hundreds of archers and greed on the screen, I did not have those in the previous games. 

[h1]Endgame & Replayability [b]8/10[/b][/h1]
Endgame there is nothing to do, The greed won't come anymore, You can just upgrade everything on every island untill there is nothing left to upgrade, You can ofcourse start a new game But it will be the same game. The islands are re generated tho, The challenge islands are a big pro here, They actually offer the rogue like challenge from the older Kingdom games, You die and you have to start over, Which sounds harsh, But where is the challenge otherwise? We currently have 3 challenge islands, But I expect we will see more in the future.

[h1]Improvements[/h1]
First up are the controls, I think double tap a direction to run on the keyboard is fine, But it gets a bit tricky with a controller, I prefer to just use one of the triggers to run. It would be very nice if we could disable double tap to run in the settings somewhere. And same thing for the tutorial ghost it should be optional, It can get annoying, Even endgame it tries to lure you to the edge of the map only to dissappear.

Ability to break down and cancel structures, Like that accidental wall you placed outside your camp, or that need to be chopped down tree all your workers keep on sacrificing themselfes for. It would also be nice if we could re plant trees and make certain structures re appear, Like the Vagrant Camps and the Merchant Huts. How many times I had my friends in coop chop down the wrong tree only to have the map ruined.

A minimap, Which shows you where on the island you are, In coop this could be just 2 player icons on the seperator line between the 2 screens, It gets very confusing when portals teleport you because you built a linked portal. A minimap would solve this minor issue. A more simple way to adjust your blazon would also be appreciated, The strange codes we need to enter now are a bit strange, Something that is in place for the colors would be a nice start.

Maybe the ability to reset islands with increasing difficulity to keep the game challenging, reset a mistake or clean up achievements instead of having to start a new game to reset the island. I would also love to see more gamemodes for coop, The challenge islands are few but nice, But why not have all of them in coop too? They can have different goals or leaderboards if that is the issue. I would also love a classic mode for the main campaign, Where dying is just the end as the only difference.

[h1]Conclusion [b]9/10[/b][/h1]
Overall the game surely improved over the last 2 games, It added a lot, The biggest change is that losing your crown is not the end anymore, Which is a pro and a con in my opinion, It completely removes the challenge, But I can see how this also allows most people to actually complete the game.

1.       As of February 2020, only one theme has been released, in december 2018, i would hope they could release new themes soon.

2.      The gems, they don't really promote the classic kingdom strategy as compared to the rest of the game. I hope they can find better ways of gem implementation in the future. 

3.      AI, as of now, many of the AI controlled characters (Knights and hermits) end up killing themselves by wandering outside of walls during attacks, also, the enemy AI has similar problems.

Like is it good? Is it functional? Is it fun? And almost everyone is just going to say that it is ""bad"", just because its WOKE. 

Uhhh... Have you ever heard of niche games? Not every game has to be made for the vast majority. Im tired of having to defend all the WOKE studios. They are targeting a very small and specific audience. Obviously that audience is not you if you do not like politics. Its fine. Just dont buy it.

I recommend you buy this game if you love politics and never ever want to escape it. Why play a video game to relax or do anything else really when instead you can be politically conscious at all times? 24/7? Especially if you love the game monopoly and wish to hasten in the One World Order.

"Kingdom Two Crowns is an extremely fun game that I should've purchased a while ago!
Although extremely challenging (at least for me) it is very fun, especially when played with friends!

It is kind of upsetting when you get to harder islands though. The monsters become more insistent and more dangerous, which in turn can make you lose everything by the time Winter comes and it's kind of a boring and upsetting season to go through if you don't have much and your citizens keep being turned into beggars.
Besides that unfortunate temporary impasse, I couldn't recommend this game more! <3

A little side Note: For those that don't know or are not sure (it seems a lot of people ask this so I might as well add it here), every time you start a new game, you can change your ruler by clicking the down arrow key. Keep clicking fast, or else the game will think you're done and will load you into the game with whatever ruler was last picked.

"I DONT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS.  It's an overrated game. This game has been recommended to me by my colleague. I regret buying it... I'll go through it step by thep... Once you build something, you can't destroy it (if you biuld a watchman outpost, soldier who is guarding that outpost will be there for the rest of the game, unless enemies will destroy it. You can't command ""your units"". You can only give orders and then wait when and if they are going to complete that order. If you're like me and you will build your base in a way so when you visit it later, it will be still amazing and selfsufficient, you are unlucky. every map, once you leave it, will get partially erased. All buildings will be destroyed, but you'll still have all the money and people you had before. So, if you get killed, you will be tossed to the first map and you will have to play the same boring level/levels all over again, just to be able to progress further. Once you'll destroy your enemies you will find out that the ""evil portal"" it's getting built again and you will eventually face your enemy again. So if you focused all your efford on destroying your enemy so you can build in peace after, you're unlucky. You have only two possible actions. You can either run/walk or toss money - if you happen to toss money in a certain ""special spot"" you will build something. The worst thing is getting from point A to púoint B. Before you can run from the one end of the map, the day will end and you will possibly need to run to the same end again to check on the damage - because you have no menu, no reports, nothing. If you get unlucky enough and you'll run out of money at some point and you haven't build your mill/farm yet and you haven't save some money in the bank, you lost already and you have to watch as the enemy is killing and destroying everything. This game is a huge waste of time. If you'll progress to the fourth or fifth map and you'll get killed, you have to play the whole freaking thing again. But it's not roguelike. When you get killed in roguelike, you can choose a completely different aproach next time. In this game, there is no other approach. There is only one way to play this game and it's freaking boring.",False,1580665758

"Beautiful. relaxing, streamlined, and punishingly difficult to learn. The paradisiacal tone and aesthetics are what really sells this game. The strategy aspects are innovatively simplistic, sometimes to a fault. Before you can win, you will need to suffer through some trial and error, and it's very tempting to blame the unintuitive subtleties of the game's mechanics. But perseverance pays off, and repeated playthroughs to master the strategy are well worth the effort.

I only played single player, so I can't comment on multiplayer. The game has some bugs, but they're not much more than distractions. I played the previous two Kingdom games extensively (Classic and New Lands), and this is definitely the best one. The series feels more like one game going through developmental iterations rather than a series of distinct games. Don't bother with the previous games; skip straight to this one.",True,1580633881

"9/10. Fantastic. I got Kingdom Classic for free, I think two years ago, and I thought it was just some random, 8-bit pixel game with generic mechanics, but when I played it, I got hooked. But, I wasn't a fan of the sequel, New Lands. Granted, I played it on an Android, but it just wasn't doing it for me. So when I heard Kingdom Two Crowns was out, I was sorta skeptical. I checked the Steam reviews to see if anything was off, and the negative comments got to me, but I still wanted to try it out. So, I have to admit it; I pirated the game to see if it was my type. And it was! So I bought it. And now, I'm loving every second. Though I hate that the hermits get off at night, and they choose to do it at NIGHT, OUTSIDE of your walls, I love every mechanic. Great work on the free Shogun DLC, too.",True,1580046502

EVERYTHING,True,1579984794
"Update: changed my recommendation to No because with every update, new bugs add to the big list of bugs. I really love this game, it really is my kind of concept, and that's why I have played it for so many hours, but I can no longer recommend something that is getting worse every day simply because they are working on new content and no longer check if the previous content still works. I wish there was an alternative to this game.

Read on for my review before I changed it to not recommended.

Recommended: yes, but barely.

Notice: this is a single player review, I almost never play it in co-op.
Edit: I would also like to add that the game is clearly not created to be played single player. It is three times as hard on single player.

I was a huge fan of the first two Kingdom's. Kingdom New Lands was fantastic until the developer used it as a beta test for Two Crowns and started changing things and never repaired the bugs that came from it. It is still playable, but not as it used to be. But this is the Two Crowns review.

It is clearly obvious that the game is build on the previous game (I should do the same) and so, it comes with the same unfixed bugs that I have notified repeatedly in the forums but never got any real response to. Coins that go into slots that aren't there or shouldn't be there anymore, units reacting too late, farmers waiting forever at the castle instead of going to the farm while there is only one farmer at the farm which has lots of space around it, new villagers stopping from coming to your bakery until you save and reload the game, and a lot more that I can't think of now but I know they're there. I stopped writing them down because the developers clearly don't care.
It also introduced new bugs: the banker always gave you enough coins to fill your bag exactly, but when there are diamonds in there, even if the bag is full, the banker starts giving you coins, tutorial 'ghosts' messages that show up at the most inappropriate times mid-game (island 4), sometimes two ghosts several pixels apart with the same text several pixels apart, both telling you to go stack your coffers when you already did that earlier and now have only 2 coins in the bag and are running for your life. Totally useless. You should be able to just turn those super annoying ghosts off or they should just be off when you started the game skipping the tutorial. And there are more bugs but as with the others, I stopped remembering them because the developer doesn't care and only seems to listen to it's elite group of testers that clearly no longer test as good as they should.

Bugs apart, I still recommend it: it is a good game, fun to play, has the most beautiful graphics and Two Crowns also comes with such beautiful music. I always look forward to hearing several masterpieces again.
The game introduces new wall types, bigger, stronger, and I like that the bigger towers are closed so that units can no longer be taken out of there.
The game also introduces more mounts which do have their function in the game. I notice that I use other tactics/mounts in different play troughs. It now also has an interconnection between islands and you can go back and forth between them until you have secured all islands forever. The timeline continues over islands so you can no longer be quick enough to skip winter.
They also made sure you really need to expand beyond your original 4 walls, which is good. It's almost impossible to only work from those 4 walls I think, where you could entirely finish New Lands + skull island with only those 4 walls, no farms, no unlocks at the start. This seams to be no longer possible.

These features come with bad gameplay decisions though:
- Winter is terribly boring. If you didn't prepare for winter, it is unplayable because it may be impossible to get coins depending on where you are. If you prepared, it is just waiting, waiting, waiting... Going to a new island is stupid in winter, so you wait... wait... wait... Attacking portals may or may not be good during winter, so you wait... wait... wait...
- There is a new type of greed: the crownstealer. It can emerge from a portal or it can be on the back of a breeder (the big one that bashes your walls and breeds new greed). This specific unit is faster than you are, jumps over walls and doesn't care about your coins but immediately takes your crown which means game over. If you encounter it in a forest, there is no way to escape it and your already 5 hours game will be over. This can happen if it emerges from a portal. If it's on the back of a breeder, you have a chance if you build up defenses with lots of walls which slows it down.
Obviously, this greed is overpowered, especially when emerging from a portal, but not only is this a design flaw, it also changes the whole concept of the game. The game used to be a very relaxing experience. You could play it to fall asleep and have lots of fun doing so (this is not a bad thing at all). But now, you can no longer say it's a relaxing experience if you can suddenly encounter such beast. The game also used to push you to join your troops to attack portals, throwing coins where needed. I thought that was a very good part of the game. I no longer dare to do that as there is no escape when this crownstealer follows you in the forest. Standing next to your troops when there is a blood moon attack is now also very dangerous. It's better to go to a well defended spot away from the battle. This takes away the fun of being able to watch the battle.

Has a couple bugs here and there, with a game of mine for instance the sword we bought (for quite a hefty price since we were strapped for cash) would just disappear.

The AI is a little on the stupid side, it would run of and attack the portal, then get it's arse murdered by the greed monsters that spawned.

"This game has a ton of promise, and in the early few hours of playing cooperatively, my friend and I were eager to learn more about the dynamics of this game, as it seemed to have a lot of depth.  The pixel art is great and the music is excellent.

Sadly, unlike most RTS games (whether it be top-down/isometric or side-scroller), where you can apply various strategies which could ultimately lead to victory (if applied correctly), you're almost exclusively funneled into a single methodology for any hopes at victory.  As far as gameplay goes, it's far too easy to ""paint yourselves into a corner"" before knowing all the ins and outs of the game, which will take several hours (even after reading a couple of guides).

If you take one (in-game) day too long to conquer an island, the flying enemies show up and eat every one of your defenders, and if you've expanded your walls beyond the camp (supplies fresh potential recruits), you're basically ruined on that map.

Killing the enemy portals is tedious and feels like an exercise in futility.  You're limited in the number of troops you can send (max is two raids at the same time which consists of 1 squire and 4 archers a piece), which even when pumping coins into the squires (their equivalent of hp), after 3 or 4 in-game days the portal barely begins to show any damage, and by then you're out of coins and all your attackers dead.  Rinse, repeat. 

The game essentially forces you to leave your island to found another by building a ship, since they don't really give you the tools you need (don't make them available to you) on the first map to pacify it and break the enemy portals there.  Meanwhile, your kingdom atrophies (degenerates, erodes, etc.) while you're not there, so you've got to play this constant juggling act between islands/maps to acquire gems, resources (stone mine, iron mine, etc.), and all the while, each day the enemy grows stronger.

Did I mention you have to build a ship each time you want to travel between your maps?  Yeah, for some reason your ship breaks on arrival at anyplace new, and you have to spend about 40-50 coins (or more, and trust me, unless it's in the summer and you've got a few farms and a banker, coins get hard to come by) on rebuilding it if you want to head back to a different island; not to mention the enemy steals the wood from the ship while under construction so you have to actively defend it while rebuilding it.

You do feel like making some progress at first, when you increase the level your town's city center or upgrade your walls, add more troops, build archer towers, etc..  But in the end, every day, the enemy gets stronger, yet you still feel like you're the same strength, archers with pea-shooters and spearmen (whose spears break after a few hits) vs. a growing hoarde of bad guys.

Extremely frustrating to have fifteen or twenty archers, a dozen spearmen, catapults, etc. and not be allowed to send them all to crush an enemy portal.

Plus, just getting the builders to be where you want them to be is an exercise in futility, their AI makes them extremely indecisive, bouncing between tasks in queue as if they can't decide where to start first, meanwhile your defenses aren't being built/upgraded and you lose 3 or 4 sections of wall because they weren't fast enough getting to where you are.

Kingdom: Two Crowns has all the elements there that it needs to be a great game, but sadly, they're squandered on an almost dogmatic, locked-in game mechanic forcing you to only really play one way if you want any hopes for victory.  It really has potential, but I'm afraid the way it is designed, you spend far too long trying to build up and juggle between kingdoms/maps for too little payout, and in the end it just does not feel worth all the effort.",False,1578762858
"Kingdom Two Crowns is the third instalment in the Kingdom line of games and it builds upon the gameplay in the previous games. Fundamentally it's a 1 dimensional city building/strategy game where you're tasked with developing your kingdom in each direction. During each day, you recruit and employ new people, build structures and generate income; each night, your people retreat behind the castle walls and defend against the greed (monsters). Where Kingdom Two Crowns improves upon its predecessors is by giving the player the ability to wipe out the greed from an island for good. This means each level now has a goal to work towards aside from simply fleeing the island.

New player experience is only bearable once you learn to constantly alt-tab to figure out obscure game mechanics.

"Last time I played Kingdom: New Lands was in September of 2018. This game came out that December. I didn't even know they were working on a new one at the time, so imagine my surprise when I was browsing the Steam store and realized Two Crowns has been out for a year. 

I really loved New Lands, and Two Crowns is really just the same game with significant improvements. As of this writing, I haven't played it co-op, but I'm very excited to try, as I always felt it would be great to play with a friend. 

There are elements of god-games, tower defense, and strategy in this game. As in previous installments, the gameplay is very simple. You have only 3-4 buttons to worry about, and the only thing you can really do as the Monarch is drop money on objects and let your subjects do all the work. Every night, waves of creatures known as the Greed will attack your fortifications, and you must prepare ahead of time to fend them off. With Two Crowns, there are new mounts, buildings, and enemies as well as new challenge islands to conquer for veteran players. There is also a mode that changes all the visuals to a feudal Japan style.

Despite the pixel art, the game is actually very beautiful. There was clearly a lot of effort put into the atmospheric aspects of the game. The sun and moon move across the sky to indicate the time of day, rabbits and deer run around the map, able to be hunted by your archers, leaves turn brown and snow falls as seasons change. Everything is reflected in the ever-present river that runs in front of your play area. The music and sound effects add to the ambiance as well.

As far as plot goes, there isn't much. In fact, most of the gameplay is taught visually, with only a rare hint from the ghost of a previous Monarch. Part of the fun is learning some of the game mechanics on your own, but it may be in your best interest to eventually look up anything you have a question about online.

I have encountered very few bugs in the game. I have some minor complaints about my subjects' AI that have been making me cringe since New Lands, such as archers constantly swapping which side of the map they want to be on. Or builders constantly going after a distant tree accidentally marked for chopping yet not being able to make it in time before the Greed come to steal their tool. 

Otherwise, it's a great way to sink a few dozen hours into an interesting, beautiful work of art.",True,1578253459

"I've been playing Kingdom since the very first Classic version, here is my review.

Pros:
+ Beautiful pixel art with elegant animation
+ Great atmosphere with nice music
+ Very detailed environment, weather, season shifting
+ Simple control
+ Auto saves

Cons:
- Needs more work on mechanic design. i.e, If I chopped the wood next to the camps, the camps disappeared and I have no way to recruit new villagers, therefore, I have to take care when I chop wood. I don't want to take care of which wood should not be chopped as I have loads of things to take care of already.

- Needs more work on UX design. i.e. when I see four coin slots on an incompleted wall, I thought its upgrade so I paid, but I triggered sending troops instead.

- Some meaningless repetition should be avoided, i.e. I have to rebuild a boat even on a cleared island.

- Needs a more clearer way of explaing objects for users, i.e. how do I know whether I should take risk to ride another creature before knowing its advantages? What does the [spoiler]light house[/spoiler] do? Where can I find a clue for that? How could I even know I should [spoiler]run out of the cave instead of enjoying watching the beautiful purple jam after I lit the bomb[/spoiler]?

- AI's not smart enough to fit the gameplay, i.e. you have to buy new bows/tools for the unarmed ones when there are a lot bows/tools on the ground, and they are still within of my town at a safe place.

- Sometimes lack of coin may lead to a dead end while just one more coin will save the world, but I have no way to get that life-saving coin. This might be a part of how the game meant to be played, but this horrible resault can be caused by a very small ignorance,

Conclusion:
I like the atmosphere, both the pleasant relax and the horror feeling when blood moon turns out. It generates a seasonal feeling of something inside.

There might be a little unconfortable during learning, but this is still a nice expernence to have.",True,1577937182

I would read through the recommendations to see if you would actually want to purchase this game. I am glad I bought it and it was a fun and interesting experience. However, I will say I wished for a better ending, rather than just credits. You may need another player to complete this game, I personally did. The first 2-3 islands one could handle on their own, but the next few islands(especially the final island) you need another player to help you(although it is possible to do on your own). I will say to anyone who has completed ALL islands and the game itself by themselves I salute to you because DAMN. I was stuck on the final island with another player for about 4 days(in RL time). ALSO something IMPORTANT, you may want to look at a guide within the community to know the basic mechanics of the game as well to what each hermit and mount(lizard, unicorn, phoenix, etc.) exactly does. A guide I would recommend that gave about all the information you need to know without spoilers(you can click the spoilers if you want) is https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1588497381.

Everything is quite minimalistic and environment is relaxing. Animations are cute, only a little bit too time consuming to finish because it takes longer than you expect for a game like this. :)

Edit: After finishing the all different variants of this game except the fun modes which weren't really appealing to my taste, 

- The mythology and few other historical events are well embedded in the game especially the norse mythology in the latest major update. 

- The AI works much much better compared to the first time I played the game. My villagers are better at positioning and picking up gears from stalls. My shops appear in a proper manner instead of every important building being on one side of the castle. I no longer had to walk 3 minutes to hire some farmers or upgrade my captains into knights.

- The mounts are so well drawn and the new monarchs have so much impact on the game, it no longer felt like ""just"" an idle game. I could finally fight enemies myself too except the flame spitting mount from the earlier.

The only downside for me is that one campaign still takes me around 3h+ to succesfully finish without failing due to attacking greedily or because of winter being so draught coin wise.

But as the banker says, ""A wise monarch always stacks his coffers"".

I'd have to rejoin or restart the game multiple times because buildings wouldn't appear built, I'd see things that weren't there or couldn't add coins to things. We played the non shogun version, and apparently in multiplayer pikemen die in one hit making one of the few winter sources of income useless as they die the night of purchase rather than generating income to pay for themselves. There were times that when I'd expand the walls, the archers and soldiers wouldn't advance to defend the new wall until night hit, and the wall would be destroyed before they got there, leading to all the defenders on one side getting massacred and me without the funds to recoup my losses.

"This is a very good game and a very bad game at the same time. I like it, but I would never recommend it to anyone else. The mechanics are fun and simple, but the main challenge of the game is managing the idiotic AI to keep it from getting you killed. Builders would stand around while walls remained unbuilt. Archers would aggro enemies far from the walls no reason instead of hunting and making money. If you can get used to all of the idiosyncrasies it's fun, but occasionally you just end up gobsmacked by a confusing, out-of-nowhere AI decision and you just have to watch as everything falls apart. Then you rebuild.

I would be more forgiving if this wasn't the 3rd game in a very similar series, so they've had a lot of time and feedback to really get this AI working more sensibly. They have just refused to allow the smallest ability to rein in your AI villagers. Heck, even just a deconstruct/undo construction feature would make it so one bad choice or one accidental input won't ruin your run. Buuuut I guess they just haven't figured out how to make the game challenging otherwise.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to finish the game. Angrily. And I'll have fun, probably. Angrily.",False,1575697966

"Kingdom Two Crowns shines with simple control and atmospheric retro-pixels. The sound underpins the gentle melancholy of the game and a loss of the crown is oh so bitterly commented.
The developers have accepted the constructive criticism of the community and significantly increased the long-term motivation. And now we can play together. In my opinion absolutely recommendable.",True,1575578558

"its like the devs dont really like to add a large qantity of content to their game to make it worthwhile buying FULL PRICE but on the other hand REALLLLY love money 

the premise is nice and so are some of the new units like the spearman, until you realize the knomes mechanic for instance was already there in new lands...

the same bs of youre not really allowed to train an army (more then two knights per side) is present and yes there are squires and they differ from knights as once a squire becomes a knight then i think you can train an additional squire but for god sake why cant spearmen charge too? is that too difficult to make? their spear literally breaks after 5 thrusts(da f*** is this bull****?)

also, you have the option somewhere in the later game to build a bomb that can destroy a portal where you lead your men into its and its like xcom's cydonia or bust you either die or win....

the amount of archers you can ""take on the offensive"" is poor just as always, you cant tell archers to have like 80% on the frontier wall and have 20% covering the closest wall behind it like always so if the frontier wall falls you lose of your guys who arent manning towers like always. also theres literally no way to counter floaters(im on the fourth island and nope)

one good addition i can think of here is the addition of a roofed tower which negates the floaters ability to pick archers from their tower, even though im not sure if its from this game or new lands

another good thing they added(again, cant tell if its from this game or the last one) is a gnome that can build a bakery that attracts vagrants to your camp so you dont need to venture out to recruit them

would have really wanted the devs to make more content i.e more unit types or buildings or better defenses or even god forbid ALLOW YOU TO CHOOSE WHERE TO PLACE YOUR TOWERS AND WALLS INSTEAD OF FIXED POSITIONS, then spending time making their japanese counterparts which are nice but you can play either this or that....

its like this game can be very epic, but the devs lack of will to make it so is whats keeping it behind. 

will the devs ever spend time  adding more content? we'll find out once theyd make the next full priced game that is essentially 90% of this one, repacked and added a new unit or two, just like this one is basically 80% new lands with a little extra content to make it seem fresh",False,1575531808

"Kingdom Two Crowns is a game that doesn't necessarily care too much about whether you know what you're supposed to do or not and which will leave you frustrated at times because of it. However, combined with its beautiful art style and soundtrack, that aspect adds to the feeling of actually being on a journey during which you build, expand and defend, learn the mechanics, and at the end of which you'll feel like you've actually achieved something.
The possibility to enjoy said journey with a friend is exactly what the franchise needed and the game is a perfect example of something that is simply ""better with friends"": pretty fun alone, amazing with a friend.",True,1575387134

"It's a relaxing game that's good for just spending some time relaxing.
It'll wind you down after a long day at work. or even just a generally stressful one.

So long as you understand the mechanics at least. 
On earlier islands there really isn't much if any challange, allowing you to just zone out and enjoy some peaceful music and a nice atmosphere. But of course once you get to the later islands some of that starts to fall away. 
It can also be quite upsetting to sometimes see your kingdom fall despite all your best efforts.

"Was waiting for this game for a long time since I love the previous part and have spent lots of hours beating it.

Main feeling from Kingdom Two Crowns: Ok, and when the fun part will start? Something new except the skins? Sure there is plenty of new mechanics but you need to play quite long to meet them. I had the feeling that gameplay for the levels is even longer than in previous part. It took eternity to see new mechanics for closing the large portals.

Perhaps multiplayer is the main feature of Two Crowns and all resources were dedicated to it, but I never had chance to test this game mode.

Pros: Game is still beautiful and challenging and contains everything that we love in this series, and some cute and cool mounts as a bonus that has significant gameplay impact.

Cons: It takes time to reach game elements that are truly new, not reskinned or tweaked. Gameflow seems to be a bit too slow in single player mode. Not that huge difference from previous game that I was expected.",True,1575309478

"[h1] Kingdom: One Crown [/h1]

It's a tad repetitive, and quite buggy still.
But for the content & experience it provides, its a game worth giving a try. A game you should not pass up on.
I really love starting up a new kingdom every now and then, and then slowly & structurally build it up. Guiding one's civilians are truly fun. I love how direct the experience is, as it's truly constructed in a way to be played over, and over, again, and again; which serves the game well.
The game is also straight-up gorgeous. the backgrounds are always so beautiful & incredibly detailed. And the entire soundtrack is honestly so awe-inspiring; it almost reminds me of C418's classic music in Minecraft, but with a twist. Even with how many times I've heard each track, I never get tired. I even sometimes listen to the soundtrack on loop on Spotify.

Although I really wish this was a more comfortable experience. I loved the ""you failed, try again"" system in my first few hours, as it never felt absurdly cruel or harsh like how rogue-like/lites treats them. But at 35 hours it has gotten very formulaic & stale. I wish there were an alternative game-mode where dying wasn't an instant 'game over'. Something like Terraria instead, where the pacing is much more continuous due to how much more straightforward it is, without any down-moments where you now have to redo your entire kingdom over.
I also hate making a word, and then I have a bad RNG seed. Which can lead me to make like 10 worlds before getting one I like.

But overall it's a fun game. I recommend to anybody interested!",True,1574955013

"Overall this game is great! You could spend a lot of time playing this game since there is room for a lot of replayability. Since the devs added more upgrading levels for your towers, walls and etc. that you have to unlock by progressing the game, they made the game way more appealing and interesting. The art style of this game is gorgeous of course and the overall gameplay is well made. I do think that they could've made the multiplayer system better since the extra person doesn't really add a lot and basically only makes the game easier. It's good that they added the option to play multiplayer nonetheless. So in conclusion, I definetly would recommend this game to someone whose looking for a pretty chill and fun experience while enjoying the amazing art style of this game.",True,1574954230

The concept is quite simple, the game that can be played with just a few keys. It's perfect for after-work relaxation.
Progress can take a good while but it doesn't get boring since you always need to be on guard and do this or that to expand. There are several secret upgrades to unlock (from new mounts to new improvements to constant buffs) and to unlock them you need to spend gems which are a limited currency that spawns on each of the five islands that you have to conquer. So keep that in mind. These upgrades are also somewhat necessary to progress.

"Kingdom Two Crowns is a delightful little game about building, expanding and defending your kingdom. A good wrap of survival, adventure, strategy and co-op. Easy to learn basics that encourage anyone to try it out. A fancy visual style combined with a sweet and fitting soundtrack. Has some minor flaws like any other game but nothing game-breaking. Hence I can sincerely recommend this game.

+ visual style with dainty details
+ music that fits the theme of the game
+ easy to learn base mechanics
+ fun (and recommended) to play with a friend
+ a free Japan themed DLC with fancy visual changes and a few unit differences
+ / - a game where you learn and improve by trying things out and doing mistakes (sometimes even the wiki doesn't give you a clear answer for your question), this could be either a good or a bad thing
- sometimes the AI does some dumb things (e.g. an archer randomly runs to enemies instead of taking a shelter)
- some features that are intended to improve your army do the opposite (e.g. Statue of Knights)
- some minor issues (e.g. when playing with a controller the sprint button might refuse to work, the cleared forest won't disappear before a quick load)

It's a sequel to the two former Kingdom games, Classic and New Lands. It builds a lot more on the former mechanics and adds more of an endgame, which is perfect because with two people you accelerate through the game a lot faster. 

Honestly buying this game on your own is good enough, because the new Online Local system Steam you can easily play the game with a friend and have a total blast. I'd definitely recommend it, as it's fun alone or without a friend if you're like me.

All in all this game is still great! It's just the recruitment camps is what gets me.

"Extremely aesthetic game which sounds unlikely with it's pixel graphics, but with its soundtrack and attention to detail in the environment, it seems like the height of the graphical style. Compared to the earlier entries in the series, this one is much easier. The easier difficulty might seem like a flaw, but it helps when playing with a friend you may be introducing to the series. The game really feels like the culmination of every game's aspects, making the game essentially the complete edition of Kingdom. The multiplayer aspect makes the game much more enjoyable, as the previous titles made you feel a little lonely in the quiet world, but with a friend it not only makes the game easier, but also more enjoyable knowing someone is watching over your back. Overall, if you're looking to pick up one of the Kingdom games, make it this one. If you want more of a challenge and don't mind playing alone, pick up one of the older games. I highly recommend this title compared to the others since it allows you to play with friends if the solo experience gets old, and makes everything more refreshing.

I don't like pixel graphics and platformers usually don't hold my interest for very long but I have played this game for over 100 hours so I guess those rules of mine are out the window! There are definitely some great improvements on Classic and New Lands that make this last game worth getting.,True,1574807339
"-Highest discount until date of this review: 30%
-Gameplay: Classic. Simple, effective and with a touch of inovation. Explore, build and watch your town defend itself.
-Pace: Slow (20km/h). It is more of a passive gameplay where you get things going and enjoy the scenery, rarely you directly battle the enemies yourself, so beware if you dislike playing this way.
-Story: Shallow. You can only tip your feet in. Almost non-existent nor important, so don't expect much.
-Replayability: Some.  New biomes (civilizations) planned to the future may bring replayability (starting from scratch but with some new mechanics and totally new cosmetics). 
-Visuals: Van Gogh. Beautiful Pixel Art and soundtrack.

The Good: Addictive (until you clear all islands then you have to hop on a new save or face the challenges). Fun either way, but there is not an eternal progression on the same save.  Multiplayer adds value (but it is not really interactive). Local co-op (play through Remote Play with even someone who does not have the game).

The Badass: Awesome atmosphere and relaxing gameplay, ""Netflix and Chill"". Discovering new features in the wild is exciting. 

...and the Ugly: Some design flaws (such as the impossibility to undo your constructions), some bugs, weak tutorial which may have you needing to start over, no endgame content on the same save (if you finish all islands, there is not really much else to do as you lose any future enemy attacking).

*Conclusion: More than worth it, bonus points with a good discount, if you are into that kind of game.

Hint: ... and PLEASE. if you play this, while expanding your walls, leave the tents from where you recruit new citizens inside your walls (leave 1 tree at each side from the tents, the ones closer to it, do not cut them down, or else it vanish and you can't recruit from that spawn ever again), a tip here is that this works for some other features but now that you know this, you can figure it out on your own.

"Kingdom Two Crowns is just as charming as the first two games in the series. It's stunning soundtrack and the pixel-art style graphics create a immersive experience bursting with personality. 

Two Crowns offers even more content and depth than its predecessors, and most importantly it offers a clear direction, with an endgame of fully clearing all five islands ! Two Crowns also removes New Lands grindy aspect of replaying islands to get unlockables, instead allowing you to strategically choose which special items to unlock. This makes each Two Crowns playthrough a different, as you can alter your tactics and play style depending on what unlockables you choose to pick up. 

This game is one you can pop into for a quick five minutes of gameplay or immerse yourself in for hours. At some points it is relaxing and calming, resembling more of a city manager. At other times it is much more intense and you are surviving by the skin of your teeth, all delivered through simplistic but surprisingly engaging game mechanics.

The game does have quite a lot of bugs and flaws (although devs are actively fixing them), but anything 'gamebreaking' can generally be fixed by closing and reloading the game. For example no catapult stations were forming for me, so i reloaded the game, and they both spawned in. 

I've fully beaten all 5 islands in Regular and Shogun (the japanese reskin) modes, so the game is definitely beatable, despite the occasional bug",True,1574773655

"AWFUL SEQUEL:

A sequel is building off the last, this third sequel is awful!
1) So basically, it's the same thing from Kingdoms Newlands; to get off the island.  This time the greedlings can take the boat apart. So you have to expand your kingdom to protect he boat.
2) Okay, so you incorperated a new currency that takes up space in the small bag you can carry.  If you get gems, it takes up three spaces of gold.  If there is nothing to buy, you either have to throw it away or hope a NPC get it.
3) There is nothing new about the game.  Okay so you need the gems to unlock certain things to use? Like a stone quarry to expand your castle and the gnomes.  i don't get it.  Same as the second sequal, but use gems to expand more.
I guess the game is made for two players so it's a new lands in two player mode with a few extra features; that sums it up.  The first two were outstanding!

It felt too easy the first 3 islands and then got totally annihilated by a revenge wave on the 4th island. Now that I know that is there, I came prepared the 3rd attempt (I died again the second time). I love the idea of taking a bomb into the cave portal and clearing an island totally. I did not like having to respawn and then grind through the islands I already conquered just to get the mounts and vagrants I wanted. It seemed pointless and tedious to do that because the enemies are already gone. I wish I was punished more for dying like the cave respawning on the non-starter islands or I got to keep all the upgrades I have and vagrants after dying.

You can't lose the game, but sometimes I wish I could. After losing my crown on the final island I found it to be a slog to get back again. It wasn't difficult or anything, it just took a bit of monotonous activities to get there.

"Having played and enjoyed Kingdom: New Lands for many hours I was excited to see how the second game had built on previous successes. The core mechanics are the same as the previous game, but they have added so much that develops those original ideas into a fuller, more balanced game. The addition of 2 separate game worlds with their own feel and differences only serves to benefit multiple playthroughs. The difficulty of play has also been upped with the addition of gems to unlock special mounts and villagers. Added to that the new goal of bombing the other dimension, which finally gives us the ability to fully conquer each land in a more ""final battle"" kind of vein. Overall the game is very good and the devs have learnt a lot from their first game.

9 out of 10.
  
  The latest in the Kingdom franchise, Two Crowns is the best one yet, now with multiplayer. You can connect via friends list and play with 2 separate computers, or play split-screen, sharing the keyboard or using joysticks. While it is only 2 player, it's lot of fun. 
  
  Although Two Crowns main draw is multiplayer, there have been a lot of additions. New mounts with different abilities, such as a fire-breathing Komodo Dragon. New enemies, like the Crown Stealer: A ultra-fast wall jumping Greed that aims for the Crown and ignores coins. And new soldiers, like the Pikemen, that can hunt fish during winter. They even have new eras to play in, giving you the choice to play in a Medieval Europe or Feudal Japan, each with their unique art styles, soundtrack and units. With more eras promised, it adds to the already massive replay value.
  
  There are a few bugs, mostly graphical glitches and a few odd AI errors. I had one builder constantly running between 2 jobs without actually building anything, for example. But the sheer amount of fun you'll have makes this game simply wonderful, especially with a friend.",True,1573306456

"If you're thinking about getting this game dont. yeah pixels are fun but this game is WAY to SLOW paced. Snail paced is being generous.  it takes 5 hours to complete one lousy boring level level. in the regular game you cant even beat the levels right away. All you do is recruit peasants turn them into archers, run left and right to do it and build utterly worthless towers. There is almost no strategy beyond getting more archers, its not strategy its just a matter of how long do you feel like waiting to harvest more peasants? Which you can take your time to do because the waves only progress when you choose to advance. More archers is the only difference maker. 

 Honestly I think its a great concept but this game is severely lacking in actual strategy. 
the devs do a nice job of explaing 5% of the game mechanics to. fine, most games are trial and error but when it takes hours to figure out what the one simple error is its just obnoxious and lazy. the error usually being not enough archers. boring.

The challenge islands which are the only real challenge in this game are completely glitched. I spent hours maxing everything out and the last portal my archers just stopped shooting at the thing. Sent 6 assaults, the first broke the portal down then they just stop firing at the actual portal altogether. They only shoot at the floaters which all of a sudden start coming out of the portal. Thanks Devs for changing the rules of the game last second too btw. 

 Not to mention a number of other bugs that you you have to reload the game repeatedly to correct. Your towers are worthless and no matter how many archers you have or how maxed out your towers are if you play the first challenge island the game just sends one hard wave if the breeders get through they knock out your whole army instantly and a mile of towers does nothing to stop it . Its pretty much the same on any map. they just produce infinite greedlings which is so flawed , what is the point of preparing if all your prep does nothing? seriously theres no point to building a single tower if they get past your first defenses then its over. how do you correct the mistake? spend another 7 hours harvesting archers instead of 5, WOW!",False,1572767916

[h1]Cons[/h1]
The game is hard to understand sometimes, there's no clear indication of what might be wrong. It's easy to get frustrated, having to google to understand basic concepts about the game is not good design.

You have no idea what something will do unless you try it, which can again be frustrating when the game gives little to no indication of how things work, or what they do.

"This game is stupidly addictive. It's a real time waster. But if you like Tower Defence and strategy you'll like this. 

I didn't think I wanted to spend $20 on the sale when the previous version looks the same and is only $5. 

But the little extra things in this like new Mounts and Gems to unlock shrines some how reeled me in.

I'm super picky and get board with games easy. If you're pretty chill and just love gaming I'd recomend the previous title as it's way cheaper and not that much of a difference. 

I've played this for hours though so I guess I better not complain about the price tag. 

CON/TIP: this NEEDS a time button to speed things up when you've got nothing to do during a day or night cycle. It can get VERY tedius running from left and right just to grab some coins.",True,1572336330
"Absolutely beautiful game, I cannot get enough of the music and am even listening to it now, remembering my adventures in Kingdom Two Crowns.

It is a kingdom management game with a blend of strategy and tower defense. Controls are simple. You can only move left/right and press down to pay money. Reminds me a bit of Majesty, but from a side scrolling perspective instead of top-down, and your (somewhat customizable between a few skins and colors) avatar is on screen rather than faceless.  Some mounts also have abilities when pressing shift, though for the most part the king pays others to do his work.

You get money through 1-time exploration rewards (chests) and through citizens with assigned jobs (hunting, deforesting, farming, etc.)  Economy management is the core of the game and along with time management and building placement/upgrade choices is where strategy comes to play. For example, if you have an outer wall established protecting your kingdom from enemy raids at night, you don't want to start a new construction project on those walls (or outside them!) if the sun is going down unless you have a proper plan in place or confident the builders will finish in time (sometimes rushing can be a very costly mistake). For this same reason, queueing up too many orders can be risky.

Economy management and building management can also impact each other which is interesting. Building walls in certain places may hinder farms or grasslands. But sometimes may need the extra wall for strategic purposes. I would recommend playing the first playthrough blind for maximum enjoyment of exploration and learning the mechanics. There will likely be setbacks or even ultimate failure, but that's okay, the learning is rather fun and enjoyable. In Two crowns, a game over sets you back to the beginning but there is still some progress saved so the next time should be easier, faster, and more efficient, especially with learning from the previous mistakes.

It was absolutely addicting. I was constantly making plans in my head on how to expand, then having to adapt when something didn't quite go how I wanted, such as my economy tanking and having to shift focus to that or a wall breaking and having to immediately pacify that. What turned into me wanting to start a relaxing looking game before bed turned into many sleepless nights as I stayed up way too long humming along to the music as I ride through my kingdom enjoying the beautiful backgrounds and forests. Even when I did finally drag myself off to sleep I couldn't stop thinking about the game.

I love it and wholeheartedly recommend it, and the OST as well.

However, just to be clear and provide some alternative perspective, the game isn't perfect and does have some flaws:

- NPC behavior is not always optimal. I've had builders spaz out and run to one building, hammer it once, then run to another construction site and hammer that and then just kinda bug out undecided which building to help with,
- The game takes exploration and mystery seriously and is rather void of warnings for certain consequences that can really hamper progress. I will just go ahead and say the one that bothered me: the game does not warn you that chopping trees down next to a camp will destroy the camp, thus forever having that camp (where new people are recruited) gone for the playthrough. Luckily, I wasn't very far and just opted to restart.
Otherwise, aside from stuff like this, the mystery and hands off approach was kind of nice and reminded me of Dark Souls.
- The season of winter if you're not prepared (so first one ever if new to the series and playing blind) Total slog fest if you don't know how to prepare for it ahead of time.
- Balance. Some mounts are clearly superior, and others completely inferior and have no reason to ever be used. I would have liked to try more mounts but never saw much need to use any other than the best ones and some intermediate ones before those were unlocked.


A side note - I did not play the original Kingdom: Classic nor New Lands, this was my first Kingdom game. I was able to grasp the game without playing those. I do not know if it's worth going back to those games after this one or not since I have not played them and I don't know if it's a straight upgrade or not.

Game has co-op, but I only played solo.",True,1572321885
"I wish there was an indifferent thumb button. I cannot recommend this game at its current price point but it is a great game full of unique features. There is not enough depth to justify $20 USD or even the $14 USD I paid for the game. Here are my reasons

- Bugs galore (I know every game has them but the ones in this game are just glaring and so have been reported and acknowledged by the developer since 2016 but still not fixed. Certain bugs are just graphical but other are game breaking)
- Too much of your workers control relies on poor coding automation, in the end a better mechanic would to be just giving the player more control over how builders and hunters go about their day. In general having more control over your units could make a big difference to the overall experience the player gets out of the game.
-  I play a lot of early access games that are much more polished than this game is which is a shame because the game has the potential to be a real gem in an over saturated gaming world. 

I see this game in its current state as a $5 game, if there was more depth (more islands, enemies, units, and tech upgrades) then maybe $10 - Go watch some lets plays to decide for yourself but overall I don't recommend buying this game unless you get it on sale.",False,1572294685

"TL;DR; 

SOUND = 10
ART = 9
GAMEPLAY / MECHANICS = 8.5

As of Nov 7, 2020 here in fucking asia I want to change my review to positive now. They have fixed most of the bugs, we got a free dlc (same shit but with abilities) from SOTN's creator so its a huge nergasm.

The shit that I wrote previously is preserved below

---



I play mostly offline (as I'm always on the go with my laptop) , so the hours might be low.

The game is really good but there are some issues and bugs that needs fixing.
I will change my review if these mechanics are addressed clearly.


I'm open to the idea ""git gud"", as I'm trying to do now , but I think these need to be addressed :


- Gems are finite (as said in the pinned post) ,  If you purchased (let's say shrine on the first island) with a gem , and restarted your campaign, the shrine will reset to being gem locked , but the gem chests won't respawn IF you have built walls past where it (gem chest) should spawn. Repeat this a number of times and you'll have permanently locked shrines.The workaround is to go to your save path and clear the save data manually to allow a real fresh start. Please provide a way to (re)acquire gems. Please avoid permanently ""damaged"" save files. Is the game supposed to be difficult or casual? If it's going to be difficult, then let it be difficult for the right reason.

For those who need it
%UserProfile%\AppData\LocalLow\noio\KingdomTwoCrowns\Release

An option to hard restart , earn gems , see gems spent and stuff needing to be unlocked would be highly appreciated. This will make everyone's life easier.

- Vagrant Camps shouldn't be permanently destroyed (or please provide a way for vagrants to spawn) What is the point of the bakery if you don't have any vagrants?
I'm suggesting a slums within a kingdom could be introduced , or please don't let it be destroyed to reuse the building assets.
The workaround here is not to cut the tress to the left and right of the vagrant camp. Just build past it.


- Banker, am I being given interest or am I withdrawing gold? It is hard to tell apart. Or I withdraw gold with interest ? Depositing gold takes time. If you drop the gold slightly next to him the more slower. you have to stand in front of him.


- Option to turn the ghost off.


- Pikemans stop fishing randomly.
A game reload works 9/10 times to re initialize these ♥♥♥♥ers to fish again.
I'm suggesting a ""last earned income"" check or counter.


- Hunters (Regular Archers, check their costume) stop hunting at some point.
I'm suggesting a ""last earned income"" check or counter.
A game reload works 9/10 times to re initialize these ♥♥♥♥ers to hunt again. Be sure that you clear the land and don't build walls on the newly cleared land so cat tails can grow and generate rabbits.


- Farmers stop farming
A game reload works 9/10 times to re initialize these ♥♥♥♥ers to farm again.
I'm suggesting a ""last earned income"" check or counter.


- Farmer Over Population
While it is the player's responsibility to check if you have too many farmers , a fully booked farm will certainly be nice to have.


- Ninjas are inferior to pikemen , discouraging shogun play.
The idea of variety is good, but it could do better.

Please see these discussions (Please grace us a bit of your time to hear their thoughts)
https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomthegame/comments/a751b6/ninja_vs_pikemen/
https://steamcommunity.com/app/701160/discussions/0/1743355067110632646/


- Deers are almost useless. Hunters will never hunt inside a forest.
They will stop at the first tree they encounter, then roam a bit and head back.
The only time deers can be killed is when they (deers) go near the first tree from your wall and you have 10 archers that are near as well. Because they run if they got shot once.
The other condition is that you rapidly clear an area , then build a wall to ""cage"" the deer, or if the deer has no more forest left to run into. One can argue that you can buy the stag mount to herd deers. Or scare them off to your archers. Should a hunter hunt in a forest?


- Cat Tails (and because of that rabbits as well) will never respawn after a winter.
A game reload fixes this 9/10 times. I'm assuming that this will prevent foraging spots to spawn in the NEXT winter as well. I suggest a ""last spawned"" check.


- Worker Tasks are stuck after clearing a mini portal
After clearing a portal , workers will still not clear marked trees. I suggest a blocking object id check or counter.
The workaround is to issue another order (mark another tree for clearing) or reload the game.


- Farmland Crops could use a ""z-index"" to allow crops to overlap with other structures. Most of the times you expand all the way out just to find out that the farm will be near or totally useless. Or add a check if crops could grow at least x units of crops before generating a farm tile.


- Bread could do better than just lure vagrants.
I mean for each bread that the ♥♥♥♥er eats , give it an increasing odds of being grateful by serving the kingdom


- Tower turns into a bakery? It doesn't make any sense. Yes it is a game but...


- Sending out a knight squad doesn't check for available squads , when one squad has boarded the ship. You can infinitely spend 4 gold coins and the game doesn't detect how many squads are left on that side.


- Hitting the a button to dismiss the ""build expand defend"" window  when you sail out needs a delay , or you might not be able to choose the island you intend to go to. The workaround is to use directional buttons to dismiss the window , or lightly tap the confirm button and wait 3 seconds before tapping again.


- You can ring the bell multiple times for no benefit. I guess it is there for an edge case of you only have 2 or 3 villages (see vagrant camps above) so you ring it again to fully board the ship. One can argue that it could be ring for fun. But it costs $.  I suggest a fully boarded check for this.


- Fire barrels could use a dedicated worker to craft explosive/fire barrels for them instead of coin. But this takes out the fun aspect of loading them up yourself. I don't know. Is it worth the micro? Should your base really fall If you fail to load up napalm ? Are catapults used to siege enemy bases ?


- When going to the next island , you need to wait out the winter for 64 minutes , that is not fun
Either give some merit for going out on a winter , shorten the winter duration and/or increase the winter frequency


- Knight Statue. Unlock them gems , but don't turn the upgrade on (by not spending gold on it, this will make your knights do a jumping attack


- Warhorse. Has super low stamina and speed. Spell Activation is also broken (binded with run button). Activating the ability/spell at the right time requires you not to run. Griffon has the best ability activation by stand-still tap.


Why some people are mad :
https://steamcommunity.com/app/701160/discussions/0/1696095261000572658/

This guy said it pretty well. But from a developer's view, I think two crowns have a different code base. It will be a pain in an ♥♥♥ to integrate and still keep the newland functionalities. Should it be sold any less for a full work?  Is it a rip off ? Do I really need money or a magnum opus? Those things are hard to balance. I don't own the previous titles to comment, but someone has to make money.

Users : please comment for anything missed or incorrect information or I'm doing/expecting dumb $hit that isn't supposed to work that way. Like I said I'm open for workarounds, the only dealbreaker right now is ♥♥♥♥-ing permanently lost gems and vagrant camps, which permanently ♥♥♥♥ your save game.

Devs : These are mere suggestions , please give it a consideration. Everything is totally up to you devs and I'm grateful for this wonderful amazing game! Love the art and soundtrack, the gameplay not so much right now to be honest. It feels like work outside of work.

"Kingdom - Two Crowns is yet another entry in the already beautiful series Kingdom. 

This is another ""point release"" that includes a few improvements and updates while keeping the core gameplay intact. Most of the updates are supplementary and welcome, but I must say that none are really relevant. They are the kind of thing that would've made New Lands more savory, but do not justify buying another game in the series, with a single exception: the two player mode (more on that later). There are new tech (that after 8 hours in I have yet to see), a new gameplay mechanic with gems (no real point in it), and optional stuff that adds variety like other mounts that are either faster or give you some sort of bonus. 

The two player mode is actually Two Crowns' raison d'être, and you definitely should pick it up if you have friends you can play with. That said, the mode could do with a few patches -- it's too simplistic to justify the 2 year gap and the new release. The second player is a drop in player that temporarily increases monster strength. She plays exactly like the first player, being able to pickup coins and pay for stuff. But, to illustrate, as soon as you move islands, or save & load a game, the second player is gone. It feels completely patched in instead of a mode that was really thought from the get go.  

TL;DL - If you are new to the series there's no reason to pick any other game (unless on Android which, for some reason, we only get New Lands). However, you already have another Kingdom game, the only reason to buy Two Crowns is to get the second player mode.",True,1572067595

You can screw yourself over however, it's easy to do that if you don't know the mechanics, of course you learn those as you play.

"Game is very beautiful
Gems limited, lost on death
It's snowing on Mt. Fuji

You're either going to have to settle with having to miss out on some gem upgrades or hold onto them tightly and google what each vague structure you can spend them on signifies, since there aren't enough gems to buy every upgrade even if you avoid losing all of them.

If you skip the useless mounts on the 3rd island, and don't lose any gems, then you'll have exactly the amount needed to buy every upgrade, but it's still a terrible game mechanic.

There are a massive amount of bizarre game design choices like that, but they would be hard to explain to someone who's never played the game before.

Like for example, everything you can spend coins on in-game isn't explained, but you're given context clues that tell you what everything does. you can put more coins into a wall to upgrade it and make it stronger, you can spend coins at a merchant near a hammer sign or a bow sign to buy more archers and builders. This would be a lovely if it was executed correctly in virtually any other situation, but it just turns into losing massive amounts of progress because you do something the game didn't tell you about properly, which gets you killed or makes you lose massive amounts of coins repairing the damages.

You can upgrade farms for a decent amount of coins, which allows the farmers you also bought for heaping amounts of coins to live outside the farm instead of going back to the center of your kingdom at night. Why do they let you buy something which could easily make you lose all your farmers if you built the farm at a terrible location (which you don't get to pick since every structure has to be built at pre-specified locations that are randomly generated (amazing idea to do that by the way, definitely doesn't skew difficulty in both directions arbitrarily based on RNG)) that in some cases can't have a wall be built around it because a Vagrant camp or persistent raids are blocking expansion since builders take a decent bit of time to travel to and from a build site, and you have to babysit the build until it's complete. if you could disable farmhouses it would be fine, but since you can't, you can cripple your source of income permanently (new farmers just go to the dangerous farm instead of actual usable farmland), effectively punishing you for buying an upgrade you weren't even told the function of.

Vagrant camps are located in the woods, and if you chop down the trees near it (trees stop you from building nearby), it'll disappear and you won't be able to hire new villagers from it. That's a neat mechanic i guess, but i'm 50% sure if you destroy too many vagrant camps on an island you could ruin your save file so you can't ever hire enough people to destroy the portal on that island even after death, since vagrant camps don't respawn. technically you might be able to slowly and tediously send new archers and knights to the ruined island from other islands, and sacrifice them to portal raids so they'll become vagrants which you can hire for coins and finally turn into builders.

You're not learning new and better ways of surviving, and trying new strategies to secure your kingdom, you're just learning what each purchase does, so you can avoid buying it until you're actually ready for it, and which tasks you need to babysit with a hawks eye because of how bad the AI is.

The AI is incredibly bad, partially because the game is literally balanced around every type of NPC acting stupid.

Why do builders run at full speed to faraway trees i need them to clear, but casually stride at a snails pace when they actually need to get back to safety, even as night falls (which is when the greed spawn). furthermore why do they try to leave the safety of the walls in the middle of the night during a raid, 8~ builders suiciding to finish a 2 builder job that you have no way of canceling. they don't even bum rush the dangerous build, they just walk 2 steps, and run back 1 step until they're outside the walls and get munched.

Why do archers stop shooting at nearby wild animals for coins even at daytime after you buy a knight who causes nearly your entire hunter supply to get sucked into their group, yet guards at guard towers still continue to hunt from their stationary position

Why do Shinobi (exclusive to Shogun palette) hide near trees far away from archers then proceed to try to melee massive hordes of enemies as they pass by, just so they can get their ass handed to them? Shinobi are a source of coins when they fish during the day, but in the normal palette the Pikemen can fish AND they have the common sense to poke greed from behind a safe wall. They cost 2 coins, and in late game it's more profitable to literally throw money at greed to get them to fuck off. But even then, why would you want to do that when you could just let your archers take care of your problems for free.

Don't even get me started on how screwed you are if you even decide to fuck with hermits. they either walk at a snails pace from their unsafe house in the woods where you unlock them, or you pay them coins to let them ride on your horse so you can idle right outside your kingdom's walls until night comes so they'll actually get off your horse and walk to safety, instead of suddenly dismounting in the middle of the woods and refusing to stay on your horse for more than a second per coin, even if you're trying to take them to safety. So what happens if they get kidnapped by the greed (enemies) anyway? You lose them, and the unique building type they could have built for you semi-permanently. You have to lose your crown and start over with roguelite 'you kind of have your progress saved from last game but not really' features to actually get them again which is a huge hassle since you have to do a lot of your busywork again to get to a state where you can actually play the game (which is just somewhat more exciting busywork really) again.

There isn't much to do in the game other than run around, spend money and wait tensed up near the thing you need to buy immediately after you're finished waiting. so WHY is there an entire season where you can't run around (no grass to graze at to replenish stamina) or spend money as much (farms decide to stop working). Winter isn't even hard, it's just annoying.

My friend i played this with genuinely fell asleep during one winter (admittedly he was a bit tired, but still) and afked during the entirety of another winter (which lasted over an hour) to watch youtube and take a shower with little consequence (i afked most of the time too, so he wasn't just leaving me to deal with winter on my own or something).

This game doesn't even work well in co-op, it seems like an after thought that sounds cool, but wasn't fleshed out fully enough to be the primary way of enjoying the game. There aren't enough tasks for two players to do, so there are long spans of time where both players will just run around doing nothing, waiting for time to pass so one of them can perform more busywork.

And yet Coatsink made another game just to change the balance on a few things, add a new game palette that makes the terrible ai even worse, and add multiplayer without changing enough of the game to actually make co-op fun. This could have easily been a paid DLC for kingdom: new lands that could be toggled on and off sort of like reign of giants in don't starve, but instead it's a $20 game. they even made a big collaboration color palette without fixing AI bugs present at release.

I will say that the game has a nice atmosphere, but all the waiting in the game kinda spoils the mood

"DISCLAIMER: I have not yet spent much time on this new update, so any bugs/issues will be addressed in my final review.

Kingdom two crowns is a side scrolling kingdom management game, it has five main islands that increase in difficulty as you reach them. each island also has it's own perks for reaching it in the form of new mounts, support statues, builder hermits and mines(structure upgrades), and the occasional chest filled with money or gems. The main point of the game is to defend your kingdom from the greed. The greed invade every night and have an occasional heavy assault during a blood moon. To stop the greed, you must obtain squires / knights to destroy the portals the greed come from. The game is played on a global timer, so any time spent away from a island base is more time for greed to grow and destroy it. This encourages players to manage each island as they grow.

On it's initial release, kingdom two crowns was a buggy incomplete and expensive game that had many issues that took some time to be ironed out, there are a few bugs that still remain, although most are mainly visual glitches. The most of these glitches came from the new multiplayer mode that was added(hence the name two crowns). I personally did not encounter many of the game breaking glitches except one point where a save was corrupted due to an update. Other issues that people had with the game was its slow pacing. for example, winter. Winter was a strong and boring part of the game that stuck out due to the long wait for it to end. During the winter there would be no income from hunting or farming. collecting money from a day's work was highly satisfying and losing it made the game feel bland as if it was just for the sake of extra game time. winter also made progression quite difficult as no income ment no way to repair the boat to leave the island or recruit new archers to defend and no money to build walls and defences. What Raw Fury should have done instead of releasing the game was instead put it into early access.

The differences with the game now is that there have been many content updates since release. Many which have tried to addressed the problems and issues that I have listed. An example of this is the winter update that added a few things to do during winter for income. Such as foraging, fishing(not including spear men) and a giant boar to kill. Each piece was like salt and butter on popcorn. Turning something bland into a much more interesting and tolerable experience. Although they did not last long, it was and is a very welcome addition. In addition to the winter updates, there were frequent bug fixing updates and minor QOL updates too. each one has sweetened the experience more and has made my outlook on the game much better.

And now, Raw Fury has added a large new update with the brand new Challenge islands. this update adds three new game modes that add a fresh new challenge to the game. Unlike winter's debut, The challenge islands feel like a worth while ""expansion"" to the game. I am currently playing on skull island which is very similar to the DLC from New lands with the exception of metal tier upgrades. It is like managing a fine line between troops, expansion and time itself. The random Generation of structures can help you get lucky early on, but increased frequency of blood moons makes it quite the juggling act. I am yet to try the rest of the challenge islands, but until I do, I will end this review here.

So, my final thoughts on kingdom two crowns as it currently is. It is definitely worth the money as there is a lot of content to play on, and all the updates have made it into a good experience. I can see the troubles Raw Fury has had an see that they do intend on making kingdom two crowns the best it can be.

Furthermore, the game is still full of bugs and can break your game several hours into the campaign, either requiring you to restart or reset the difficulty if you die because of a bug. Resetting breaks the game by making it too easy.
The game has potential, but needs to be priced lower and have its bugs ironed out.

Sometimes your hermit refuses to leave the back of your mount for the whole day and then proceeds to hop out at night and wander outside the wall just to be taken by the hordes. The fact that you don't directly order the units in the game is frustrating on so many levels.

"Revised-
The game is grindy. I mean that the game's time is padded out by this need to get money quick to fight off demons. Golly ghee, a survival game with padded time? That's right you might wonder well that could be no problem, until you realize, hey after a certain amount of nights, these demons get pretty darn-toooooot'n.
This leads to expanding, which the community will kill you for not recognizing a glitch as a mechanic. Ghee how can expanding be a glitch, gamer? 
Allow me to explain. The game adapts a mechanism that has the player use coins to cut down trees. Clearing treed areas allow for farming and wider hunting. Well ghee gamer, that sounds like a decent mechanic. Yes, my friendly metaphor-of-general-community it is. The trees stop the player from expanding too far outside of their reach, so you may wonder, well golly how do I get people to cut said trees. Easily explained with a bit of poverty put into servitude. You will find bums outside your forts huddled in together begging for a chance to improve your land. The downside? You have to keep 3 trees within the boarders of these bum towns to keep the bums spawning. That sounds like an easy task though, gameeer. Well you would imagine, but like I previously mentioned the trees are used to keep players from expanding outside of their territories. GAMER, THAT SOUND LIKE MEECHNNIC YOU DONT UNDRRSTAND GMAE, stupid gameeer. Your brain must be so frackn smoooth bc you do not undrrstan game mechanic. 
Well how is it a mechanic when they just recently implemented allowing resetting game saves? Gamer you have to learn to play the simple gmaeee omg, this is a masterpiece you donut undertand. 
Whoa, you really turned that friendly into a fiendishly. Furthermore, I really love how the entire antagonist for the story is these demons called the greed. The enemy almost seems like a metaphor for something.
I think if I ever actually finish the whole story I will write a critical examination of what all the symbols of the game might mean in my own analysis, until then, ""Light wood laminate"", ""Light wood laminate"", ""Light wood laminate"", ""Light wood laminate""

beautiful game, really grindy. Buggy. Biggest issue. Saves getting corrupt. Here is the resolve as of current.

* Archers mysteriously air moonwalking to towers on a new island (harmless and still funny)

* Farmers, Builders, Archers, Trader acting like it's night after a portal's taken down (happens frequent but randomly; fixed with a save and restart of host)

* Catapults randomly sticking around, stacking up when you expand to a new wall. Most are invisible but still fire (Sticks around most of the time, helps unless a squad of Fatbois come rolling up)

* Catapults not recognizing a wall/ going to the wrong side (happens infrequently, not fixed on restart)

* Portals built by host not showing up/ showing as in construction to Co-op partner (Happens fairly regularly; fixed by rejoining host)

"Kingdom Two Crowns is a hard game to rate. It's good, and if you look at it by itself then it's definitely worth it. However, if you played either of the previous games then it feels like nothing more than a mini multiplayer expansion. There are a couple new mounts and 1 new weapon but I felt like I was just playing kingdom new lands again. The levels felt the same, the monsters were the same and basically everything was the same minus a couple small features that you probably wouldn't even notice unless you're a diehard fan.

Kingdom two crowns is a superior version of the game, because it's basically 95% the same game as new lands but with a couple new features. If you're a new player then buy this game and only this game, you don't need to play the previous versions. If you're a new lands player, then really consider if you want to buy this game full price for a couple new features. 

I think two crowns was the result of the devs promising too much. This was probably meant as an expansion for new lands, but since they promised all future dlc for free, they had no choice but to make it a separate game. 

I'm leaving this a good review because the game is good. However, I don't recommend it to older players unless 1) You were a huge fan and want to support the devs regardless 2) It's on a really big sale or 3) You want to play it with friends..... Because let's be honest, you're paying full price for what should basically be a free expansion (due to their promises of all future dlc being free).

I remenber pre-ordering New Lands on its release and being blown away by how many new things were added, how much dept was given to an originaly simplistic title. As pros, the game adds even more content, a new art style (with small gameplay changes) whit more to come, new mechanics, FOOKIN COOP MATE, a permanent win, another extremly good soundtrack and lets not forget the new blazon simplification (you don't have to look up a guide to change it now). As cons, a lot of people would tell you the game is buggy and a mess but in its current state, which is constantly improving, it has a couple of bugs which are mostly minor and also some frustrating stuff (the tutorial ghost for exemple) but ther'e working on it.

",True,1566616793
"Kingdom Two Crowns is a rogue-like, side-scroller game about monarch(s) fighting off the greed infestation on five different islands that increase in difficulty each time. To do so, one has to strategically manage coins and use them to build walls, towers, farms, assign roles to townsfolk and lastly seek ways to expand and destroy the portals spawning greedlings, the enemy that relentlessly attacks your camp every night in search of coins, townsfolk tools, gems and lastly your crown.

Losing the crown and allowing the greedling to successfully escape marks the end of your reign. However, that doesn't end the save file, it is actually possible to respawn how many times one might want, keeping buildings (not walls) and upgrades.
This offers a slight relaxation factor to the game, but I am here to tell you that that isn't the case and here is why:

The incoming groups of enemies are always getting stronger by the [b]current island day[/b], [b]global day[/b] and by the amount of [b]enemy portals destroyed[/b].
This means that it doesn't really matter in which order you choose to fully clear the islands, the last ones will always be the most difficult. So unless you want to be inevitably, utterly destroyed, you might want to keep an alert pace at all times.

Relaxation is out of the equation, so let us continue to mechanics and movement.
The game pretty much uses three keys in total: Right, Left and Action (Down). With the Action key you buy tools, build buildings and walls, upgrade said buildings and walls, recruit vagrants to become townsfolk, cut trees and so on.
Simple, creative, enjoyable. But it only goes down hill from here.

Movement is next. As the monarch, you are using a mount at all times. You can find other, more useful mounts along the way even though both singleplayer and multiplayer have established, indisputable best picks: [spoiler](Griffon=SgPl) (Griffon+Lizard=MltPl)[/spoiler]
Naturally you are unable to attack but two of the seven mounts do allow it: [spoiler]The Bear and the Lizard[/spoiler]. As mentioned already, the [spoiler]Lizard[/spoiler] is a top pick and the [spoiler]Bear[/spoiler] puts you in more danger than you can clear.
Every mount has a fixed stamina that determines how long a mount can sprint (Double tap on directional keys). Some can run a lot, some cannot but have other perks as balance. To restore stamina a mount needs to spend some time not running or be left to eat some grass. (Only light-green grass counts and the forest, the place where you most often need to run, is designed to rarely have any.) The [spoiler]Griffon[/spoiler] runs fastest out of all the mounts and can recharge anywhere and does so fastest, therefore a top pick as well.

The detrimental part of the game is everything else not already discussed and it is, unfortunately, a decent chunk of the game.

[h1]1)[/h1] Income is important and usually the first thing everyone focuses on at the start of an island, be it the very first start or a departure.

- The easiest income is the Merchant. Only Island 1 & 2 have him. He is using a donkey to walk to the Merchant Camp (visually different than vagrant camps; does not spawn vagrants) and brings back 8 coins. The first trip is free but to send him away more times, he'll need one coin each trip.
- The second option is hunting. Archers usually group around the outermost walls and walk outside to hunt during the day. A rabbit/raccoon yields one coin and deer yield two each but try to run when attacked. Deer appear in the forest, rabbits/raccoons appear from small bushes that need a clean field to spawn. It is ideal to have a medium patch of open space right outside the walls.
- The third, last and best source of income is farming. Farms can only be built on locations where a small river can be seen on the ground. Having any amount of expansion past the initial walls makes the scythe seller appear. Scythes turn jobless people into farmers which will constantly grow plants next to the farm, harvesting them and repeating infinitely unless unprotected of course.

! Both hunting and farms are disabled in winter.

Like many other developers, Kingdom's don't understand that making a rogue-like (random generation) game is tenfold more difficult to polish than a fixed map one. I talked about towers, walls and farms but I must now mention that you cannot build wherever you please. There are fixed places where each type of building can be erected.

- Small, brown piles of dirt = Walls
- Rectangular, grey rocks = Towers
- Rivers = Farms

The generation being random means that it can really screw your game up a lot, making your play several times more difficult out of sheer bad luck. For example, an island could spawn with no farm rivers, crippling general progression. Or maybe have three walls spawn right next to each other. Or towers too far from walls where they cannot protect each other.

Linked to this issue is the recruitment/townsfolk/workers issue.
The game has two main resources, coins and workforce. The only way to get more people is to drop coins for vagrants to pick up. Doing that turns them into civilians that run towards the first available, free tools to pick up and start contributing.
The vagrant camps are inside the forest and for some reason, [b]require to be in a forest or else it disappears permanently[/b].
To avoid that, two trees can be left alone next to each side of each vagrant camp, but more mechanics mess with that:

- You cannot build anything unless it is [u]free of forest background[/u].
- To clear forest background you need to [u]cut the trees on the edges of the forests[/u]. (Can't cut just any tree)
- If there is a vagrant camp in the way and no other possibility to skip the trees, one has to cut the tree, but that would permanently remove a critical resource from your island. If you don't cut the tree, then you cannot build. If you cannot build, you cannot expand.

Camps are not easily sacrificed either since they only spawn two vagrants per day and the farther away the camp is, the less chance they have to make it to base without getting robbed by the greeds.
An island with no rivers and too far away camps is a solid restart. But what will you do if that happens on the last island? After you already spent several hours reaching that point? A real kick in the bum.

[h1]2)[/h1] Another unpleasant thing one has to deal with is the AI of the NPCs. Sometimes they listen and run toward your bought project, even during night, sometimes they just run back to base and refuse to move until morning, even when the threat has been cleared.

Archers and jobless people walk during the day and run during the night. But it amazes me how the greedlings are designed to spawn even during daytime to reach the wall during night, but the archers aren't. When it turns dark, the archers suddenly wake up and run to their posts even though the monsters are already at the gate and they are 200 km away from it. In that situation they don't even cancel their run once the wall falls and suicide charge instead.

[h1]3)[/h1] And the last major bug/broken mechanic I will cover in this review is the miscellaneous building. The game has special buildings that spawn within the walls once you've expanded enough. One of said buildings is the Forge that is a key building for destroying the main greed portal on each island, since a bomb payload can be bought there. Other special buildings include catapult workshops and spearmen/ninja barracks. Sometimes, even if decently expanded, these buildings fail to show up, requiring one or more client reboots. Walls sometimes fail to update their damaged appearance as well.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
The game concept is simple but the simple things are often the most poorly executed. A lot of aspects are unpolished, many mechanics contradict each other, random generation can doom you before the game even starts.

"Welcome to the third installment of the Kingdom franchise.

Two Crowns has seen some transformations that set it apart from the other two titles, with additional characters, artifacts, as well as Coop gameplay. For those who are familiar with the series, you’ll find that it plays pretty much the same as the last releases, with a few added twists. If you have not tried the series, I would recommend you start at the first release and work your way to this one, unless you're looking at the coop gameplay. It does not matter in which order you play them story-wise, I just believe it is best to start at the beginning of any series.

We start shipwrecked on the first island. As you begin exploring, the ghost of a previous ruler beckons you to follow them. It leads you down a path that has gold scattered along the way.  As you quickly collect it up and continue following the spirit you come across two peasants at a campfire. The spirit instructs you to hire them with your gold, and to light the campfire. This will establish the start of your kingdom. With fire ablaze, you will purchase tools for these two peasants who are now your loyal subjects. Your only options will be an archer or a builder to start with. You will now need to start building your defenses in order to protect yourself and your followers as you expand your empire. At night the monsters attack when the moon rises. Lose your crown and its game over. As you continue to build and upgrade your kingdom, additional classes will become available with new tools for your subjects. These will include a sickle for farmers and a spear for guards. There are mysterious shrines on the islands, and you will need to figure out their purpose. From here you're on your own; build your strategy and escape from the islands.

Released on Dec 11, 2018, by the developers Noio and Coatsink, & Published by Raw Fury, I have tagged it as 2D, Pixel, Adventure, Coop, Strategy, Randomly Generated, Casual. In regards to my rating, it is mostly easy to learn and play; there is a learning curve to the idols and shrines which makes it slightly harder, yet not overly difficult. There are plenty of features, giving the series a breath of fresh air. Most notable would be the addition of coop gameplay (does allow drop-ins). As a huge coop gamer myself, this was a great selling point. Enjoy new characters and idols, shrines, mounts, and defenses along with secrets hidden throughout the dark forest. Free DLC content will take you to exotic new lands from around the world. We currently have the Shogun DLC, in which you will need to enlist the help of the ninja to create new strategies as your adventure heads into the thick bamboo forest of Japan. There is more to come as they are programmed adding even more playability to the game. With full controller support to play it your way (I preferred the controller over the keyboard and mouse), beautiful pixel graphics and a lovely soundtrack set the mood for this addictive indie game.

I am enjoying this release as much, if not more, than the previous two games. Its unique genre-blending makes for fascinating gameplay; I can get lost for hours at a time if I don’t watch myself! Once I get friends who buy it, I’ll be able to dig into the coop, and once I do, I can pretty much guarantee it will be a favorite. I do want to play a while longer and learn everything I can before diving into the coop. I love the changes that allow you to go back and forth to islands once you leave them, a feature that will be a strategic necessity as you progress. The new mounts are really neat and fun to discover, they also serve their own purposes. Figuring out what all the idols and shrines do has been my biggest obstacle. A little background information on their use would have been nice. As this has been the formula since the first game, I really can't see playing any other way. Should I really need to, I could always head over to the wiki, although I really do try to avoid this as I prefer figuring out all the mechanics myself. The randomly generated world results in ever-changing gameplay with tons of replayability, making the title exceptional value for your library.

The time is at hand for you to decide if Kingdom Two Crowns is destined for your library. Choose your ruler, king or queen, design your crest, and expand your kingdom.

"i think its time to write out a comment on this game, and i gotta say, the amount of bugs is INCREDIBLY annoying.
the game itself is very nicely done and even got me to play up until the first island completion, after that the game started to fall apart.

it seemed the more me and my friend progress the game didnt get more difficult, but it started getting more and more buggy. 
after about 2 islands and half of the 3rd, my game started to just die. builders would just run outside and die, pulling catapaults outside and never being able to create new ones even after they have disappeared, villagers randomly doing nothing even if their are tools they can use, and i even had villagers get stuck inside the lake all the way at the bottom of the screen somehow.
after all of this, i gotta say its a good game, but not even close to finished yet, so marking it as so is a real letdown.",False,1564024486

"Good game, like it's minimalistic yet complex design, but...

Look. It's good but the multiplayer has serious desync issues, buildings not building, mounts vanishing. Also a fair bit of it's difficulty can be considered arbitrary, although that's not a bad thing. Pikeman are seriously broken though, in terms of their ai and glitching things out

I wouldn't normally mind a few game breaking bugs here or there in what is essentially a well polished flash game if it wasn't as high as 16 quid. On sale, definitely grab this the series is amazing. But don't grab it full price",False,1563967826
"This game is actually the third game of the kingdom series. I've only played this and kingdom two crowns. I have to say, this is a pretty big improvement compared to new lands, and I haven't even played multiplayer, which I'm sure I'll get bashed for. The biggest improvement is having a way to beat the greeds by going into the cliff portal and blowing the nest up. The (short) new level where you go into the cave and beat greeds up is vary satisfactory and lets you actually end the game. Have no idea on what the lighthouses are for. The other great thing about this game is you can play the shogun version. Having a completely different feel is very refreshing. One big problem is trying to get the forge, which is not easy nor very clear on how to do it. You have to get the ninja house first, then build a tier 3 wall, very frustrating, but I do love the getting a better knight option. Maybe they should just have an option to upgrade a tower to the forge? Other than that, I very much look forward to future dlcs, (new ottoman faction?) that let us explore more locations, in a wider range of terrain? Maybe even ally with npc factions? More enemy variety? Very excited for the future of this game.",True,1563926305
"The pacing is slow. The leap in difficulty from the 2nd island to the 3rd is too large. Things such as the knights/squires, banker, etc are not explained well and you need to go on the wiki to figure out how things work.  It is also still buggy and the AI is dumb.",False,1563918956

"The most common cause of losing Two Crowns: THE TUTORIAL...in the middle of the main game. If your walls begin to break, the game's astonishingly aggressive and completely unwelcome forced tutorial routinely pops up to wrench control of the game away from you and refuse to allow you to spend any money or take any action until you follow a random ghost to some broken wall (often on the other side of enemy forces) and repair it. I can forgive the inconsistencies and difficulty spikes and lack of any real effective signaling on the part of the game, but games with this kind of permadeath can't murder you routinely from technical error.",False,1563601182
"Getting an instant game over from an enemy that basically forces you to cower in your walls before the sun even goes down is bs. No strategy to it other than hide and hope your archers kill it. It makes a noise only when it spawns making accompanying your troops for an assault suicidal as it can spawn from a portal and instantly jump at you before night time even hits as the greed spawn not when the sun goes down but at the point where they can reach your walls by sunset, so once a Crown Stealer takes your crown there is no stopping it as it will simply outrun arrows fired at it as it runs away. This is not a fun enemy to work around, worry about, or deal with. It's not even a situation that causes fear or panic as you'll either be sitting in your fort during the afternoon, get instahit during an assault, or your archers miss and you lose the crown.",False,1563572310

"DON'T BUY IT. I'm serious. 

I really enjoyed the predecessors and, in theory, the developers added some fresh and interesting mechanics to the Kingdom franchise's addictive core gameplay loop. However, several months after release the game still suffers from game-breaking bugs which will heavily hamper your defenses and most likely cause your island and ultimately your kingdom to fall.  

It's that kind of tower defense game, where your tower defenses don't work. Literally unplayable.",False,1562890163
"I can't currently recommend the game since I think it has too frequently occurring bugs that seem to happen on every play. Your dudes sometimes start carting your catapults outside or to the wrong side of the kingdom, ruining your defence. Also the tutorial ""ghost"" guy sometimes appears in the late game, and can be tricky to get rid of.

Apart from the bugs, this is a pretty neat and stylish game. The graphics are really nice and the music is beautiful; soothing or tense as appropriate. Also the animations are really nice and fluid. The season and day/night shifts are nice.

The gameplay mechanisms are maybe a bit too simplistic, a bit more control would be nice. More than one of my losses were due to starting construction by a mistake at a critical moment so that my front-line was ruined, which felt a bit cheap, being able to cancel construction would be a welcome change.

The very end game got a bit tedious too,",False,1562858493
"While Two Crowns is fun and has a lot of potential, I would not recommend paying $20.00 for this game until it goes through several more bug fixes. Why these bugs are severe enough to warrant not buying the game altogether is because several of these prevent one from playing through much of the content, and finishing the game altogether. 

For example, the game relies on upgrading your keep and expanding your territory to progress through the game. This works by having the game spawn in new buildings as you upgrade and expand, and having these buildings open up new options for interacting with the land. One such building is required to enter and destroy the larger portals that dot each of the game's islands. If this building does not spawn, you cannot progress past this point. Unfortunately, the player does not control what and where buildings spawn, it is handled internally. For that reason, if the game decides not to spawn in the building, one cannot complete the game's victory condition, which happens to be destroying all of these portals.

Yes the game has many irritating bugs and the multiplayer is not in a very reliable state at the moment. That is not why I am writing this review. Having bugs that entirely stop a player from progressing and requiring a reset renders the game near unplayable (That is, you can always start a new save file and hope it works the next time). While many games have bugs, having ones to this degree, in a game that has only one save file per campaign and little to no modding community, does make it a more serious issue than say, having a potentially game breaking bug in Skyrim.

I have no problem with the developers of this game and think the game itself is enjoyable. Were these bugs fixed, this review would not exist. However, if you're thinking about purchasing the game, you should know that bugs exist that can completely end your playthrough, and you need to consider whether that possibility would still make a purchase worth it. I would at least consider buying the game later when it is not only cheaper, but in a more working state.

Now the Cons.

I cant recommend this game in its current format,
Compared to Kingdom New lands, this sequel is far too easy and has removed all aspects of danger.
there is no wave that could potentially threaten your city and there is no danger of running out of gold.
in most cases u are overflowing with resources and the enemy attacks are Pathetic at best.
Bloodmoon's are rare and even if u attack 2 Portals at the same time, the Counterwave is puny compared to the Original.

u wont really be challenged and the game turns into a contruction simulator with 0 chance of really dying and u literally cant kill yourself ''no joke''
u will try to push your luck to get some kind of threatening wave, but it just wont happen, the '''Greed enemy' has been reduced to nothing.

I wish the developers will add an additional option to increase difficulty, even if its a expansion.
i have bought many copies, kinda regret it with how easy they have made this game.",False,1562639150
"An entertaining microstrategy game, Two Crowns is (in my opinion) the best version of Kingdom we have so far. The base game mechanics of both classic and New Lands is still there, but now there's the inclusion of a legacy system and a campaign.
   Especially for foolhardy people like me, the legacy system (which is how the 'campaign' by and large functions) allows for you to restart with a new character on the first land every time you die (note that you die when you 'clear' an island), and you retain all your infrastructure, progress clearing out the greed, and vault. The only things you lose are the bonuses, mounts, hermits (which are used to create specialized towers), and boat building progress. Needless to say, this is very helpful, and while this sounds somewhat snowball-y, that's because it is. Once you complete the first island, big brute squad of knights in hand, the other lands are much, much easier when you return to. You don't start with all techs unlocked, and you will have to advance to islands 2 and 4 to unlock stone and the top tier buildings (and you need the top-tier buildings to 'clear' an island), so that balances out your steamroll. This also has the added bonus of giving you incentive to return to the previous islands, which I then found relaxing and enjoyable as opposed to stressful.
   The art style is honestly pretty adorable, and the creators have done an outstanding job at making the environment stand out. Each one of the mounts has a distinct style and special trait (my favorite used to be the stag but then I discovered the griffon). The music is also a marked improvement on its predecessors, of which I didn't notice it at all. The current Shogun update and hopeful future environment updates give the added bonus of different units/challenges, but also a different visual flair if you don't want to see the European style.
   I must say that I enjoyed playing this a lot more than I expected I would, considering that Classic and New Lands kind of chased me away earlier. The legacy system and the added tutorial messages, while occasionally finicky, do much to help newcomers to the game while not telling players everything they'll face or need to know",True,1562601834

"TL;DR: Lots of new features and content make this game awesome and more fun than its predecessor. Bugs encountered didn't affect gameplay, but multiplayer can take a while to set up.

Being a huge Kingdom:  New Lands fan, I was looking forward to this game. Bought it soon after release, but after reading a number of reviews about ""all the game-breaking bugs"" I let it stew in my library for a while as Raw Fury gave it some TLC. I'm glad I did.

A LOT of new features were added to this game. You can play this with a friend, which make this a blast! A new resource, Gems, was added which changes how you play and what you can buy. There are new mounts, which are a blast. Just about ever structure got new upgrades, to the point where it'll take you a several hours to explore them all. But these new structures usually enable conveniences that make a satisfying difference. Island-hopping has new significance, and completing the game is a more complex and difficult affair this time out (vague so as not to spoil ya), which I really enjoy, and which gives the game plenty of fun challenge for its value.

The visuals in normal version were slightly improved, which was appreciated. The new visuals in the oriental version are simply gorgeous. However, the experience is sometimes marred by a few visual bugs.

Speaking of bugs, I didn't run into any major or game-breaking issues, even in multiplayer. Raw Fury has taken the time to address all the really significant issues that players were experiencing. As of this review, the only bugs I experienced were visual—more amusing than anything else. There were none that caused the core gameplay to be affected.

Multiplayer is a lot of fun, as mentioned, however it can take a while to get the session going. Usually, it only takes one to three tires to establish a good one, but a friend and I once took over 20 minutes trying to get ourselves a multiplayer game going. May have been less-than-stellar connection, but for a game that doesn't need much networking, I was a little disappointed. Once the connection is up, everything generally works fine though, which is good.

"THE GOOD: Great balance of chill grind with some frequent dopamine payoffs.  A good progression on Classic and New Lands.  Good single player but the couch co-op is definitely more fun.  The new upgrades and unit types change the gameplay for the better.  Graphics and music are top notch for the pixel genre.  Has a bit of a Superbrothers S&S vibe on both but isn't too close to other games in the class.
THE BAD: The difficulty spike hits hard towards the end game.  Unless you read the Wiki, be prepared for lots of trial and error for things like winter, gem upgrades, and fighting portals.
The Ugly- Can't pick custom banners.  No instructions for how to use co-op.  Second player controls are awkward unless you have a controller hooked up.  Can't go from co-op back to single player without closing the game.

"Fantastic game, was not impressed with classic back when it came out, New lands was a breathe of fresh air and did a lot to improve on systems I thought were good but lacking in Classic.  Two Crowns successfully does this again when it came to things in New Lands I wanted to see expanded on.

Some elements in the game can make or break campaign, but I am noticing those are diminishing with times as the developers update and improve the game.

11/10 in my books, look forward to more from this studio!

EDIT: Norse Update ~ I do like the new update immensely, it has fixed a fair few problems that had been plaguing the game since the beginning
• I definitely like the update to the archers leaving the inner most towers 
 once you move your walls further out and thus make those towers useless until the wall it taken out. It is also fantastic that the archers no longer suicide at night to fill towers that the reaper greed take... now we just need implemented for the workers
• The Beserkers are interesting, albeit suicidal and costly if you don't have enough of them (Beserkers don't reappear behind the wall once hit enough like ninjas, but instead turn back into a worker and then hit again and lose their hammer/axe)
• I like the Ballista tower replacement for the norse, definitely prefer it over the Ballista (albeit a little iffy since now the greed go super fast when offscreen to reach the wall and thus making it's accuracy abysmal)
• Mounts are interesting, though I've always been partial to the lizard in the non-norse campaigns.
• The Items are cool, Hel's empowered one definitely helped with the ""knights don't wanna kill portals"" bug.

overall I was not disappointed with my purchase of the DLC, definitely recommend.",True,1561867360

Big fan of the Kingdom series and this one is no exception.,True,1561833634
"Took me some time but after completing the first island, I've decided to write a quick review of this game. The game is essentially a side scroller with elements of exploration, expansion and strategy with lots of trial and error (or reading those Guides).

Following closely to the successful formula or Kingdom and Kingdom: New Lands, Kingdom Two Crowns ups the ante with new features and more exciting challenges. No longer can your turtle on an Island for long without moving to a new island. Surviving on Island 1 on Day 100 without any upgrades to higher tier Walls, Hermits or Statues is no longer possible. The game challenges the player (as the Monarch) to move and explore to new Islands. In fact, it rewards exploration and those who are aggressive enough, taking calculated risks. Islands now have RNG layouts so no two game plays exactly similar although structures and Hermits are still found on fixed Islands.

The Greeds now come in various shapes and sizes, each with their own unique abilities. You will need your wits, careful planning and finally taking a risk to overcome these odds. Different Greed can be countered effectively with different Subjects from your Kingdom with the right upgrades. Once you have mastered what are the key upgrades, Hermits, Statues and Subjects to hire you will be able to overcome whatever the Greed horde might throw at you.

Lastly, this game adds a Co-Op Multiplayer option which is a welcomed addition. Two Monarchs can work together and wreck havoc on those Greeds, if they do things correctly. Although there are some multiplayer bugs (and significantly lesser amount on Single Player after the latest patch), they are not show stoppers and the game runs well even with the few hundreds of Subjects which you may have running around. 

Oh! And did I forget to mention that there is an endgame? Yes, you can destroy the Greed once and for all, on each of the Islands (there are 5 of them in total). Once you have destroyed all 5 of them, you would have won the game! Now you can safely say ""The Crown is Safe!"".",True,1561831173

" I will say though that I enjoyed playing it. I like the medative slow build of the game. The game mechanics in terms of the ""campaign"" are a bit simple and easy because when your hero dies time resets and you can just let your king die to avoid the more annoying winter months and fear of harder horde spawns. It's a fun game but its probably a better one to own on mobile, as mobile generally doesn't have many good games and the mobile version is basically the same

It was a day one purchase, and boy, was that a mistake. The game has been riddled with bugs that still aren't fixed.

The difficulty is a joke, this game is so easy, it's almost unbelievable it has anything to do with the original. We only lost our crowns once due to our own mistake of not running from the bomb. Otherwise nothing proves any challenge. 
Where are the random blood moons? I think we saw one random one through the whole game. Where are the escalating waves of enemies as you progress further and further? I remember I was proud to get my 100 day achievement in Kingdom classic. In this game you just auto pilot past it.

The difficulty leads into what its biggest crime is; it is so BORING. I introduced this game to my friend to play with, and we struggled to keep playing. Eventually we finished the game, but it was a painful experience.  

The game still looks beautiful, but that's pretty much all there is in common with Kingdom classic.

If they were to add a multiplayer mode of the original game, I may be able to check out the game again, providing bugs were fixed, but as it stands, I will sadly be staying far away from the Kingdom series.",False,1561802715

- can be a fun game to play with a friend or on your own
then you'll like this game.

It does have a lot of shortcomings and hiccups though, including an annoying and completely lackluster reward upon killing the Greed cores with an unskippable stat screen of how many friggin' turnip farmers you hired before having your crown stolen this go 'round, and with a tutorial that lacks a LOT in terms of the bigger mechanics at play, you really will have to enjoy the exploration portion of the game to not feel like you're just throwing coins at random objects with chaotic results. And that will result in you fucking up your game more than once, so be ready to restart your kingdom without much fanfair. It's unavoidable if you're going to learn at all what certain things do and what the cause and effect of that is longer term.

Ninja is a joke when instead of staying in bushes, they decide to fight the Greed head on sometimes, and they don't even pick up the coins, left those despawn. And why do they have to go back to the Dojo to change clothes, unlike Pikemen??? I ask this because sometimes the dojo spawn near the town hall, but I need them to help defense at the last portal. They waste so much time running back and forth just to change clothes, and it becomes stupid when they change clothes to Ninja and then day time is back again, now they turn back and change again without fighting.

Now why do I like it? Well, let's start from the cover, shall we?
I see many people say this game, and, pixel games in general are trash because they are pixel games, to which I respond, ""Do you see a different way this game could work? A different art style?"" So that aside, is the art good? Well, yeah, in my opinion, but that's something you can see for yourself since it's right there, above me, top of the page, but I personally like the graphics and the game can look downright beautiful at times when combined with it's awesome soundtrack.
Oh yeah, by the way, it's music? Awesome, it goes really well with the graphics and the style, it's calm, it's not energetic, it suits your role very well.
So how's the gameplay?
Well, it's really simple, you throw around coins, those coins can build and buy stuff, those coins can recruit random people in camps, who can do jobs using tools you buy and do certain jobs thus earning you more coins.
oh and also something about an enemy that comes in waves that get stronger and stronger, yeah that too, but who cares?

So do I think this game is good? YUP, it's fun. Should you buy it? Ehh, it's really up to your judgement, in my opinion for a singleplayer experience, Kingdom New Lands feels a little bit better, because Two Crowns was designed mostly for multiplayer.",True,1561219875

Original review below.

----------------------------
After sinking some hours into this, I come to the conclusion that this game is not really worth it's money.
AI of your units is horrible. Controls are unclear. Map generation is questionable.

Some examples:
I. King buys a bow: every single jobless runs to that one bow, even if later you buy a hammer or anything else. It does not matter that there is just one bow, everyone runs to it. One exception - later in the game you can have as much equipment stored and new people will simply chill in some other shop for who knows how much time.
II. King orders to fell a tree: worker goes to fell a tree, time of day - or night - does not concern this fellow labourer, bless his soul, so he goes.
- IIa. He fells a tree and [b]stays right there[/b]. When night horrors come, he perishes if he was too far away. 
- IIb. He encounters night horrors on the way to the worksite. And perishes.
- IIc. King places a different order. The tree is forgotten completely. But eventually, a worker will remember. And goes there. Look at previous two points.
- Addendum. There is absolutely no way to cancel an order once it is placed.
III. King advances to Iron Age. The forge does not spawn. The end. (borders have been expanded. twice. all walls are iron-level)
IV. King arrives to a new island. There are no brooks. Which means no farm income and no stables.
V. King orders to make a sword. All squires run to it. Yes, [i]all at once[/i]. See the first point. Then squires and knights return to their posts. [i]At walking pace[/i]. Yes, you got this right, your armsmen run when a) you sound the attack; b) they retreat after defeating a portal; c) you sound the bell to board the ship; but not when they need to return to their posts.
VI. King - valiantly - leads the assault into the lair of night horrors. King has his trusty - albeit slow - warhorse. After heavy combat (island 4) King orders to activate [i]the device[/i]. King perishes. He had some gems. Those are gone, likely forever. This is not mentioned anywhere.
VII. King rides a horse. We have squires, knights, catapults, but, apparently, spurs do not exist. Horse runs out of breath in the night. The end.
VIII. King wants to start a new game. He is now a black queen. And there seems to be no way to change it.",True,1560970202
My friend and I absolutely love the co-op version of the game. Despite a few glitches that we have encountered it runs smooth for both of us.

"I really like this game for what it is capable of but I certainly CANNOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone! 
Simply because you can't make a save for any instance. You can only save+exit and you can never start from a desired part. If you think you made a mistake at some point you'll either have to close the game tabbing out or start over from the beginning. The game basically becomes a slog for bigger population and hermits every time you realize your mistake. I spent about 14 hours into this game and boy was I frustrated when I got buttfcked by some jumper greed. Hell, I don't mind that this enemy is in the game but the developer's audacity to have us start over from the last island with no hermits, no steeds, NOTHING at your disposal. That is not content that's just rinse repeat. A game can't be as punishing, frustrating and boring at the same time. I had the first 3 islands cleared and when I lost in the 4th I was sent back to the 2nd island where I just wanted to pick the hermit and steed with me. Why does the ship have to be dragged all the way to another end when I just want to pick hermit off the island. Why can't I have any of those even when I lose the crown. Why do I have to wait out nights and move left and right to get those things again??? I'm not sure of this but the game will make you lose in the fourth island by bringing winter. You will have no income whatsoever and you will desperately lose if you keep hope. Best is to just dump the crown and start from previous islands which gets easier when you get back.
This game shouldn't be priced at $20. Nope! 


The audio is great. The pixel graphics are amazing.
Overall level design is also quite good but it's just bad when it comes to saves, lack of information of what's going on.

"After playing the beta for the upcoming Winter changes patch and actually finishing the game solo as the original/euro faction, I would definitely recommend this game.

Starting from nothing more than a horse and a few coins and maybe a somewhat familiar ghost (depending on how well you've played prior) you've got to set up your walls and defend yourself before night arrives. You spend most of your time Picking and choosing relevant upgrades and saving for important purchases. While also discerning what parts of the land would be best clear-cut to make space for towers and walls or maybe left alone for the wildlife to hunt for. Weather you should staff archers or maybe focus on recruiting spear-men. Keeping catapults topped off with flaming barrels or outfitting towers to acquire a few more knights. Go exploring for gems and lost gold. Maybe investing with the banker fella for winter? You've got a lot of choices and management options in-game, and little time to do it. 

You're Royalty after all. So you dont directly have a hand in combat situations, but your choice of mount and where/how you utilize and place defenses is just as important.   

For being a 2D side-scroller it feels like its got a lot of depth and polish to it at some points. Though there is still some nitpicks here and there. They're really minor and not game-breaking. A quick reload fixed every issue for me. Mainly when you time attacking portals poorly and trigger a blood moon right before an annual blood moon or something and give yourself permanent nighttime by accident. I've also loaded in once or twice with a few breeders/behemoth greed monsters right next to my walls or myself. 

TLDR: Its a really pretty and fairly relaxed, hands-off, yet not, game that feels like it'd be one that lives up to the ""easy to learn, hard to master"" mantra. The music is very well done too imo.

Phenomenal game, but Two Crowns has too many bugs. We dealt with them for a while, they were just a bit weird but manageable, and then our game file became corrupted and we lost all progress.

"I love the game: simple, relaxing, challenging and the music is so good.
I also personally like the Shogun DLC better than the base medieval version, but the Blazon customisation doesn't seem to fully work, compared to the base game. The Tinctures and Ordinaries work fine, but the Charges don't seem to appear. It would be a nice touch up to make it work. The last update is nice though, with the new way to customise your Blazon, but not all the Tinctures or none of the Charges (at least in Shogun for the Charges) seem available if you use the new assisted way.
I also just noted that (again with Shogun) I just restarted a solo campaign 2 days ago and once I travelled back from the 2nd island to the 1st, I couldn't use any coins or gems. I think it's a new bug, because it's not the first time I did this in both the base game and the Shogun version.
It's a bit sad because I love the game so much, but I just had to stop playing.
I'm not new to the game, I watched Mr. Fruit when he did a series before the actual release, and I have 34 hours on record yet (as on this day).

Sometimes NPC's despawn and respawn at random points,

[i]Kingdom Two Crowns[/i] is a very fun 2D strategy game with minimalist 3-button controls, beautiful pixel art design, fantastic music. It gives the player enough to do and to think about, but at the same time, the simple design takes away a lot of the control and leaves it to the hands of the AI. A caveat to veteran [i]Kingdom[/i] players, this game seems to be a bit easier, so be aware of that when you head in.

When it comes down to the simple-design, the three buttons can work well for some people and make it more frustrating for others. If you have played the previous [i]Kingdom[/i] games before, you will know exactly what I am talking about. When you have a single button to use money, and the other two keys makes your monarch move left and right, you can imagine that perhaps the inability to control a lot of what goes on might be a bit frustrating. 

If you have never played a Kingdom game and can't make up your mind, I would recommend that you go start from [i]Kingdom: Classic[/i]. I know there's plenty of embellishments and additions since the original game, but the fundamental gameplay concept and the series of things to do are almost the same. If you can't get past that in terms of the value of the concept and gameplay, then definitely don't bother with this game. You can make it easier and look up YouTube videos or watch someone stream one of the games. Though I would have to discourage you from doing that, because part of the fun in playing this game, and either of the other two is to discover on your own what you can and cannot do.

Does this game offer more than the previous titles in the series? Yes. Yes in that there are more things to do, there are some small but clearly puzzle-esque elements in this game that you have to just figure out through experimentation and playing. Of course, what kind of puzzles can you add with the simplistic style of the game? I don't mean to be a jerk, but you really should play to find out. I have spent enough hours to say that I have played this game enough to know more or less what I should be doing. But maybe I shouldn't say that, because I just lost a crown before sitting down to type up my review.

The other big addition found in this game is the availability of local coop and online coop. You can play with two people managing the game instead of one. This doesn't seem to make it more difficult. I was goofing around and tried a little bit of two-hand split-screen as a single player. I couldn't get it to workout too well, because I had trouble actually managing everything in a timely fashion. Even still, it made everything feel a little easier. I could not feel that the game was any more difficult with two people. (Someone correct me if I am wrong here.)

At the end of the day, you will either love this game or hate it, I think. There's not much middle ground here. If you love it, you might play until sunrise the next morning, even though the game can be saved and you can quit at any time. If you hate it, you might get past a few day/night cycles in-game, which is only a matter of minutes in reality, and then never touch it again. The simple but effective strategies that you will develop to take this game along its course is what makes this game fun. 

You move left, you move right, you use money with the third button. There's not a lot here seemingly, but the discovery, roadblocks, and overcoming these obstacles is what makes this game amazing in its own way. If you are seriously thinking about playing any of these games in the series, just trust your instincts and dive in. Don't watch any videos, don't read any more about it, just play. (This is why I didn't make a video, and why I am not really talking about the specifics of the game details within. It's up to you to make those really awesome discoveries and to figure out what works and what doesn't work.)

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics are pixel-style but are amazing. I remember being absolutely stunned by the details in the original [i]Kingdom: Classic[/i] when I played. Some people might not be into pixel artwork, but it's truly remarkable how well an atmosphere and environment some pixel artists can put together. Compared to the original [i]Two Crowns[/i] is only better in this department.

[h1]Music[/h1]
I do think this game has a rather outstanding soundtrack.

[h1]Audience[/h1]
It's easy enough for everybody to learn it. Once again, it's a game without words, so there's no reading, only discovering by playing. 

[h1]Pricing[/h1]
Is this game worth $20 USD, which is the base price? I think so. 

[h1]Some Potential Frustrations[/h1]
-Your actions are going to be repetitive, so brace yourself.
-Lack of ability to manage your soldiers may drive you to drink. If your stronghold is being attacked from one side, half of your soldiers are fighting to their death, while the other half are shooting idly at bunnies and deer on the other side.
-Funds and the seemingly constant shortage. This will take you some time to get used to. It's potentially run-killing/time-consuming in the early game if your investments don't have a good enough return yield.
-You may have to try for a long long time going after some of those achievements, they are tough.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[i]Kingdom Two Crowns[/i] is really good, so you should definitely give it a try. The coop might make the game a bit easier, and I do believe that it is a bit easier compared to the previous games at baseline. Perhaps in trying to make the game progression a little bit more friendly, this is a slight tone-down that seems reasonable. It would be nice to have difficulty options.

This game is going to see some additional free updates with time, so it will be exciting to keep an eye on for the future as well.

Simple and fun, but complex in unexpected ways and potentially frustrating at critical moments. Discover it for yourself.

What's the point on having a game that forces you to play it by such strict meta? Isn't more logical to be able to win the game in as many ways as posible to apease many players?
This game punishes the player for not playing as the devs want their game to be played and that I cannot recomend.

"Kingdom Two Crowns is so close to being a good game, but not quiiiite there. It's probably worth playing through once, which will take ~5-10 hours, but I can't really imagine replaying it very much. The art is great, as is the overall atmosphere, but the gameplay loop just never quite works. You're incentivized heavily to rush as quickly as possible through islands and effectively ignore a number of the mechanics (e.g. there is minimal reason to ever destroy any portals on one side of the map, or build lighthouses). 

Some mechanics you can't ignore, like winter, which will occur after a set number of days no matter what, only detract from the experience. Effectively it just forces you to do almost nothing until it's over by drastically  cutting your income. But it isn't really a challenge -- the only times you are threatened by enemies is right after you choose to destroy a portal. So just don't destroy the portal and you'll never be in danger of death by anything but boredom once winter hits. Most of the mechanics are extremely obfuscated by design -- someone might enjoy the process of figuring out how things work, but it can also be very frustrating -- it's easy to cripple yourself unintentionally if you don't realize how a given mechanic operates. Especially the lack of any ability to undo building actions makes it easy to accidentally ruin a base.

The base of a solid game really seems like it's here, but it's just hobbled by some unfortunate game design decisions. I still think it's not a bad idea to check out in coop if you're looking for a fairly relaxed game and to look at some cool pixel art, but I wouldn't recommend it strongly, and don't think most people would want to play through more than once or twice.",True,1557883291

"I'm a bit late reviewing this version of kingdom because I felt there were a lot of bugs on release. I didn't want to give it a thumbs down, because frankly, I want more versions in future. I do love playing this while I'm watching twitch or youtube, because it's relaxing and takes just the right amount of attention to play while listening to/watching streams. I used to have Civ on for times like this, but I'm not that fond of VI, so Kingdom has been my default.

Now I think they've tweaked it enough that I can give it a thumbs up wholeheartedly. There's even word in discussions that a blazon editor is coming, which will be nice. I can't vouch for the co-op as I stopped playing that early on due to the bugs, but I plan to try again now.

It's worth getting for the single player game. Some annoying game-breaking bugs have been fixed, like builders stopping their jobs for no reason and standing around. Now they seem to be working properly. 

Spoilers for new stuff in gameplay follow:

Play is much the same as prior Kingdom games: amass coins from hunting archers, chests, farms etc. and build up your walls and defenses.

There's a new unit in the pikeman. They can kill multiple greed at once at your walls. They fish and provide coins, though not as many as they did at first. They seem to take more hits than they did and you have other winter money earning options now, so that balances out.

The twist in this Kingdom version is that after destroying portals on the way to the cliffs, you can hunt the greed on their own territory by building a bomb and taking some knights in to hunt them down and blow them up at the source. This renders your island safe (ish, the walls still fall etc. when you leave, so that's odd.)

Gems are used to unlock statues and hermits now. They've added a place to stow them next to the boat which has removed one less thing to worry about and plan around. It was hard in the beginning, if you picked them up, to have room for coins to build larger upgrades, like the best fortress or unlocking the highest end walls. Now that's not an issue. You can, however, run fast past them to leave them for after the gem stowing thingy spawns. (Ditto with gold chests and it's not a bad idea to leave one or two waiting for your next visit if you can).

You have to perfect timing of travel to islands and how much you build up each one before moving to the next. You gather enough gems as you go for island one's statue, hermit and mount and go back there to get them. Timing is very important if you want to finish the game in one reign. Race through and build up too few defenses and when you return to that island later on, you'll be swept away by a tide of greed who will tear through your defenses like paper. Take too much time and you won't make enough progress by winter or your crown will be stolen. You can destroy the dock portal to build a lighthouse that enables you to return to islands without crashing your ship (higher levels of lighthouse reduce crashing probability, I think).

Winter works differently in this version. You have two timers going, basically, one is your overall (perhaps reign timer? I haven't checked, I've been too mad when I died!) and one that tells you how many days you've been on a particular island. Overall timer lets you know when winter comes, which I won't specify a number for since it's more fun to be surprised. Just have your boat ready and bank fairly filled and if you notice the river reeds/plants reddening for autumn, make sure you're ready for winter. I tend to go back to the islands with a merchant for winter and finish them up, but with the new mechanics introduced it's become easier to survive on any island. Your farmers no longer throw down their expensive scythes at sight of snow and if you put a coin in the berry bushes that spawn and they're close enough to the center, you'll be fine.

The only mechanic I don't care for is the crown stealer, but they've tweaked it, so it's no longer as unfair as it was. You go through the game the first time learning how to play and you're taking too much time because you're learning and all of a sudden something leaps out of nowhere and takes your crown whether you have coins or not. This is not playing by the established ruleset, really. The game devs say that it's a penalty to overstaying on an island and it doesn't mean game over. When I first died to it, I had defenses and troops and it got me in the middle of my base and I felt it was unfair. I don't think this would happen now. I've seen one once since then and it died almost instantly to my troops. So, if you've been on an island a very long time, just be careful. Don't accompany your troops to a portal fight, make sure you're always near a sufficient amount of troops and verify the thing died, because it will take you out in one hit. It is avoidable though as you move through islands faster.

I do wish they'd allow you to escape out of the island win stats screens so you're not trapped if you don't care about optimizing every archer.

I think the game is easier than its prior incarnations if you're not worried about one reign, but it's still fun. I believe they made it easier to make it more forgiving when playing with a partner. Now that they've ironed out some of the kinks, it's great fun to play and it seems like they're entertaining the idea of releasing more biomes in the future. The Kingdom games are still an instant buy for me. I get a lot of entertainment for the price.

"Fantastic and very interesting side scroller.

This is my first game in the series, I have not played the previous games, but I still found this game a lot of fun. It's an interesting game, where you have to manage your ""kingdom"" by giving coins to allocate work and/or jobs. It's a bit different in terms of game play as you never really involve yourself directly in fights and such [spoiler]until maybe you get the lizard or the griffon[/spoiler].

The game takes getting use to, as in what to prioritise to build first and which units to have around. At the beginning it is rough as you see a lot that you want to put coins into and how to manage your coins. But after playing a few times, it does ease and the game becomes quite calming. Even when you are attacked at night, the game doesn't make you panic or even stress you out when it does.

The co-op part of this game is still new to me, as I have not tried it out but I have read and heard that it runs like the single player mode but just with a mate to help you around.

As most people probably already commented on this, the music in this game is is beautiful. Very calming and very soothing. Definitely a plus to the game.

Lastly, the only thing that I find that I can complain about this, is that the price point is a little too much. In Australia, it is $28.95 which is quite a fair bit for this game.

Overall, I found that Kingdom: Two Crowns is a fun and interesting game. Something a bit different ad unique. If you are after something that is calming and just for you to ease into, definitely give this game a try.",True,1555384089
"Kingdom Two Crowns is just a rare gem to me... I usually don't play games of this sort because it does not interest me as much, but am I glad I gave this a try. (Keep in mind, I do not own Kingdom New Lands, I have been told that this game is a lot like it.)

Although it has its problems, It still has some very unique and amazing features that overrule those problems, but I hope that they fixed by the future...

Lets start with the 3D pixel art style, It's such a beautiful and calming style that not many games have... Running through the dense forest or conquered lands of its Japanese or European oriented geography and atmosphere in its 3D pixellated style is bizarre and just very warming to look at. I sometimes find myself spaced out just looking at the background and water.
And the sound track is just well made for the game, I love Running through my Japanese empire while Ashen Crown plays, It gives me a sense of relaxation and emotion towards the empire itself, how joyful it is and secure for the villagers.

Then there's the Hostilities of The Greed, a slime-ish tar looking enemy that wants nothing but what you work hard towards.

There is multiple types of Greed, which I will not spoil away, but just know there is variety, all of them have their own ways of making your day a little more complex.

Gameplay is amazing, especially with a friend, It gives you a sense of simple power but at the same time you don't have to micromanage everything they do, as they find things to do on their own.

Now talking about doing things on their own, there is a few minor problems with the game itself.
They sometimes do somethings that you rather them not do... for example build something or cut down a tree you'd like to cancel. They also like to choose where they go and stay, sometimes needing them on one side of the wall and they just hold their ground on the opposite side. Sometimes a sense of control is ideal.

And that you can't cancel purchases or sell/destroy buildings, That is a bit frustrating and makes you be wary of your purchases and actions, which is okay in a way.

And when you destroy all the camps on your island and can't get any more villagers do to that is also frustrating, but again that you can fix by being careful, but I wish there was another way to obtaining villagers for more units.

Other than that, I haven't had any game breaking bugs yet, I've read that they are there, but I haven't had any. So My score for the game would be a -8/10-. If they fixed the bugs and made a few more additions to the game it would be such an amazing game with more re-playability, I also recommend you buy this instead of Kingdom New Lands, as its very similar as stated above.   -8/10-",True,1555306401

Another example: when bringing the ship to a new island with lighthouse, the ship just gets stuck at the pier near the lighthouse and won't go into the kingdom, meaning I can't board the ship at all to leave the island. So frustrating when I just want to enjoy this otherwise fun game!",True,1555109743

"DO NOT BUY. You will hit game breaking bugs after about two and a half hours of game play.

"People are saying this game is just New Lands redone. People are also spreading a lot of false information through their reviews. THEY ARE WRONG.

As someone who has played and beaten both the previous Kingdom games -- this game is beautiful and delightful. Addictive as heck and more fun than the previous ones. This one feels more like an actual game. There are a lot of differences, but I won't name the ones I'm thinking of here as I don't wish to add some serious spoilers regarding gameplay. The game is easier in welcome ways, and it is more challenging in others. Two Crowns really starts to be different after you hit the fourth island. Do NOT fall for the idea that it is just New Lands again or just a DLC. Don't let negative reviews influence you based on false info.

I've played for a LONG time. I can say with absolute certainty that single player has almost no bugs that I've experienced. While online multiplayer has some bugs, the devs are very active in the community and hear most complaints, and I'm more than certain they're working to fix it. I've played split-screen co-op for a number of hours as well - and there are no bugs that I've encountered. Some people say they can't see the coin slots above certain things - as I have seen myself, the ship cannot be paid to leave an island by the secondary player without the first player beside them and it is likely intended to be that way. The first player, meanwhile, can pay for the ship at any time.

Split-screen MEANS that your screen is going to be smaller. You might not see things high up on your screen, but rest assured the functions remain the same as always. 

Beware that many people are claiming to encounter bugs that are not bugs, but rather game mechanics they didn't understand. This game is WONDERFUL and well worth the purchase.

UPDATE: Have now beaten single player. No bugs save for one which hardly affected anything: a deer spawn point wouldn't despawn on the fourth island while I was clearing forest, so I couldn't clear forest in the area properly. 

The game can get slowed down from time to time, but it isn't anything drastic and that could be my computer or simply the fact that I had a LOT of archers.

SPOILERS AHEAD.

About the forest: it was a small patch of forest and hardly anything to worry about. Clearing the forest from the opposite side may have fixed it, but I wouldn't know as I didn't want to clear the vagrant camp that was nearby. It did, however, fix itself after I bombed the cliff portal. I should note, as well, that I played single player in the Shogun biome.

About winter: There IS a way to make money in the winter in Shogun, despite people telling you otherwise. Pay 1 gold to a berry bush cluster, which only spawns in the winter, and your farmers will harvest gold from it. This can be done multiple times per day on one bush, and if the bush is close enough to your camp you're GUARANTEED a full bag of gold per day. Watch out for boars!

About the forge: Expand your base. It will spawn. MAKE SURE that you build up all four walls around your original camp all the way to iron, and that you leave enough space for it to spawn when you do expand. Make sure that there is lots of room between two fully upgraded walls, as well -- if there isn't room to spawn, it won't. If all of the above requirements are met, try restarting the game -- sometimes other things spawn in the spot where the forge is trying to spawn, and resetting will fix this.

About the New Lands comparison: New Lands felt rushed, gameplay-wise. If you didn't get off the islands by winter you were in for a bad time, typically. Money was scarce and the game was intense and quick. THIS game is vastly different - starring an ability to keep progressing despite death, which was absent previously. I cannot tell you how many times I died in New Lands and had to restart all the way at the beginning of the game - it's an EXTREMELY welcome change that Two Crowns allows functional progress.

People are saying archers are walking on air. That's not a bug --- your archers are spawning to reoccupy towers you already built, because towers are not destroyed through decay. If you watch them, they run and sit in the archer towers. This is a harmless thing that doesn't affect game play and shouldn't bother anyone.",True,1555043016
"They keep releasing DLCs for the game without fixing achievements and multiplayer bugs.

The game is very good, don't get me wrong. But the sole purpose of the ""Two Crowns"" version is to be a co-op experience, and its co-op functionality is shit.

I've played every single DLC to this day with the same friend.

My friend never receives any achievements (even I don't receive some of them), we can’t see each others animations, such as mount abilities, and we constantly experience desync issues during our playthroughs, even though our internet is good and works great in other games.

It's a great game overall, but prepare yourself for some frustration if you care about achievements and cards.",False,1555017086
"Ok so this game is good, it is a lot like new lands but that's fine. I dont recommend the game if you are not going to play with other people and you dont care for the new stuff. Even if its just to play single it has new stuff that make it entertaining. 
I dont understand everyone complaining that it should just have been a dlc and stuff. Like let me be honest video games are an extremely cheap entertainment, by this i mean that if you play a 20$ game for 20h then that was only 1$ per hour of entertainment but if you were going to the movies you would need to spend 20$ on only 2h of entertainment. So for the people complaining i get it they let the people that had kingdoms upgrade  to new lands for free but that does not mean that they had to do the same for this one

The game is really fun solo or with a friend, because you'll know how to manage things together after the 3rd Island, you'll start to notice how hard the game is. I really recommend you to buy it since they also added new stuff <3",True,1554777087
"No ONLINE MATCHMAKING!!!

Don't buy it thinking you can play it with anyone, to play this on coop mode you have to be friends, and have matching work/school times, and both having the game and the will to play it at that specific time...
if any of these is a no... than you have a singleplayer game, almost nothing different from the first one!

I hope this will save some people their time and money, as I bought this being led to think there was ""two crowns"".

Edit: After developer response - ok so the game has some different things, not that different anyway, and still its a single player game, unless you have friends that can play this particular game with you, or go searching for some people to play... and thats a no for me, sorry... you should impement a matchmaking for coop... its not like anyone will be forced to use it, and everyone playing online with the matchmaking are aware that they can find some trolls online... like every single online multiplayer game...

so at least my review should be helpfull for people that dont know this dont have matchmaking

"I still love this game. I haven't had any gamebreaking bugs (I can't even remember a crash honestly), even though other people seem to have encountered them. The music is, as many people agree, extremely beautiful. The graphics are gorgeous if you're into pixelart. It's a very relaxing game to play with a friend. While it may be true that it feels more like a DLC to Kingdom New Lands rather than a new game, I gladly gave the developer more money for this one. I still remember that they gave away a ton of new content for free when they decided to give New Lands to everyone who owned the original Kingdom. New Lands felt like whole new game so that was really generous. 

Two Crowns develops the concept even further, improving the new features by introducing gems and giving you the opportunity to travel back and forth between the isles. You can play with a friend, which is very fun. Two Crowns, two sides, two players, it makes much sense. It's always nice to have a friend to defend the other side of your kingdom. 
There is new beautiful music, the graphics are more diverse. I still love the concept and feeling of the game, it relaxes me much and I regularly come back to it.

Recently there were a few updates, quite a few bugfixes and some balancing. Winter had been my only critic in this game so far. It was pretty boring just because you had no money and therefor nothing to do. With the last update it's much better now. You can forage and hunt in the winter which helps much. I also had the feeling the winter was shorter, but that might have been my subjective view. You also get a shady ninja that helps with all the gems that clog your money bag.

Overall: If you like what you see this far you might wanna give it a chance. It's a beautiful game. The people who made it put a lot of love and details in it, that really comes through to me while I play it.
I'm looking forward to what will come from the developer in the future.",True,1554609570
should be 5 dollar dlc,False,1554600234
"While this game has numerous improvements and additions to New Lands, I still prefer New Lands. Greatly. Let's talk about why.

Two Crowns adds gems, which act as upgrade points for various things, like getting hermits, new mounts, and going up a tier of technology, among other things. While I do think they are an artificial method of not allowing the player to carry as much gold, I still enjoy their introduction. What I do not enjoy is the general gameplay loop of this game.

In New Lands, the objective is going from island to island. Land, build, defend, escape. In Two Crowns, at least from what I have gathered in my 34 hours, your objective on each island at the end of the day is destroying every portal, both at the docks and the cliffs. Now, I've cleared Skull Island in New Lands twice. That's no easy thing to do. However, this game does not feel nearly as balanced as Skull Island, and I wouldn't call Skull Island balanced to begin with. This game doesn't care what season you were in when going back to a previous island. It will throw you straight into winter and you'll be shit out of luck when it comes to getting money and grazing. I would've liked it a lot more if it did a hard reset on day/season like in New Lands. New island, new universe. The only things that should carry over are what you bring with you. Otherwise, everything should be hard reset. If they make another game, they need to do this.

I really don't get why most people prefer Two Crowns? While I still enjoy the game, I get frustrated with this one. I rarely get frustrated with New Lands. The only parts of New Lands that frustrate me are the AI breaking and Skull Island. In this game, it's several things, mainly boiling down to the season carrying over on each island. If you're gonna make it realistic, balance it. And speaking of balance...

I have a feeling this game was at least partially balanced with co-op in mind. I've never touched the co-op but I can imagine the game becomes a lot easier when you have two competent people playing in the same world. In my opinion, playing solo should roll back the difficulty a little bit, and playing co-op should ramp it up. Just saying.

If you merged New Lands and Two Crowns into one game, it would be a masterpiece for me. Unfortunately, the great new ideas like gem upgrades and the new mounts get bogged down by the rough edges surrounding the progression. Let's hope their next game will be more balanced.",True,1554554895

But I'm completely addicted! I'm already 35 hours in, and I don't plan on stopping soon. If you liked the first two, you'll love this one. They took the idea and refined it and perfected it.

UI is extremely simple, with only 4 keys, you can move, interact with items and skills. Even through the UI bugs are annoyed, if sever UI options are overlapped with each other.
Graphic is also simple, just have several layers (Especially the water layer) to make it looks vivid and beautiful.

If you still want him too be a thing that can be stolen, make the dog house breakable! Kinda like how the greed can break walls. I still enjoy the game, but I lose the dog every time.

"SO... MANY..... BUGS........ The forum is covered in bug reports and complaints but the developers do absolutely nothing to remedy the situation.

The game is really nice at first glance, the art, the music, the idea behind it all will suck you in... Once you get past the first little bit, everything starts sliding downwards.... You start noticing NPC's flying in the air, npc's floating in the water! Builders sitting outside the walls and dying! Archers not firing at anything! Woah I can just keep listing the bugs!!!

Update: As of the august 29th patch, the game is still riddled with bugs. On top of that, Skull island challenge island is bugged once you destroy a portal! It is permanently stuck in a bloodmoon. Restarting a few times does fix the issue, but it does not fix the knights stuck on the left side and refuse to come over to the right side thus leaving you with 1 knight to kill portals! Almost like the developer didn't test the release! 


On the bright side, the much needed extra content for challenge islands is a welcoming site, a little late but it is nice regardless. 

SUM: I recommend you pick this game up ON SALE, do not drop a full 20$ on it! On top of that, prepare to encounter bugs upon bugs during your playthrough, most which can be fixed with a simple restart. Regardless you will encounter playthrough breaking bugs one way or another it's just a matter of time....

UPDATE 2020-02-26: It's been a rather long while, but I am here to add on to my review. I haven't really touched the game since I posted this but that being said, there really hasn't been much change in terms of the product itself. Still covered in bugs and AI that sometimes just don't do what they are supposed to.  

THAT BEING SAID, The developers have opened up their line of communication greatly and are definetely more involved with the players in their community on the forum and posting teasers as weeks go on. They also released a very small QoL patch a few months prior. I will give a koodoo's to them but from someone who rarely writes reviews, I must continue to give this a thumbs down based on the current state of kingdom: two crowns. 

MY HOPE GOING FORWARD: I truly hope they go back and fix some of these terrible bugs that continue to get reported but not fixed. Do a serious QoL pass on the AI itself to which would remedy most of the peoples complaints. 

Looking forward to whats next!!! UPDATE  2020-05: They reskinned the game 4 times, added some easter eggs and a new button. Along with that came 'the second wave' of bugs. On the bright side, they have opened up a BETA branch with very few bug fixes, but it is a start.",False,1553196878

"Overall rating: 4★ out of 5★ 

This game is great. Simple yet beautiful pixel art compliments an enthralling soundtrack with repetitive yet interesting and addictive gameplay. Shogun Mode adds replay value and spices things up a lot as well! This game is not very difficult once you get the hang of things, but despite finishing the game twice I keep coming back to play more. 

However, I have two issues that keep me from giving this game a solid 5★ 

1. Lack of anything to do during winter, which cycles seasonally and is not avoidable. There is no income whatsoever during winter in Shogun Mode, because you lack pikemen to fish. I would personally suggest making winter more difficult, with more greed spawning (or perhaps spawning during the day) or special enemies/bosses spawning. 

2. There is no way to adjust difficult for the game. After your first playthrough, things become too easy, and despite how addicting things are, being able to crank up the difficulty would make it a lot more challenging and fun for vets!

Besides these issues of mine, the game is lovely and I adore it. I have not experienced any bugs like the other reviews claim, at least that I've noticed. I highly recommend picking this game up- or better yet, buying two copies, because Two Crowns lets you play with a friend!",True,1552954920

Graphics: Very nice to look at most of the time, though it is very similar to the other games.
Music: There are so many now. And they are very good too! It really sets the mood well.
Improvements from other games: In the others, it was a kind of ""let's see how far I get until I inevitably die"", which I personally thought to be annoying.  You couldn't really ""progress"". Now, You can destroy the portals, and secure your kingdoms. The game does get harder over time, but this time it sort of encourages death.... ok that sounds weird, but what I mean is that when you die, your kingdoms decay a bit, some walls will break, etc. But you're not completely restarting.

"A year later, an update to this review. The game is now mostly bug free and plays very well. I can now wholeheartedly recommend the game. It's more of the same, but it's exactly what I was looking for.

----------------------

Lovely game, builds a bit on the previous game, but if you played New Lands, it won't feel that different. A few new things here and there, but mostly the game is the same. Not a bad thing in itself, especially if like me, you absolutely loved the previous games.

With that said, the game is riddled with bugs. From knight's refusing to pick up the shiny swords you built for them, to archers running out of your walls at night to go man empty towers, when said towers have been sitting empty all day and they would have had plenty of time to man them then. When you go back to a previously completed island, you can enjoy watching archers walking in the sky to reach far out towers and marvel when your pikemen completely stop fishing generating absolutely no income. Did I say that sometimes your builders will just stop working, and not repair walls? Yeah, it's fun to lose your kingdom that way.

"Okay, I love it so far.  Same great gameplay with some new events (that meteorite scared the heck out of me!)  Same beautiful pixel graphics, now even better.  The trees are as stunning as the water now.   Well, almost.  The water is still amazing.

As for the gameplay I wasn't sure about the diamonds at first, but like others, I am okay with now.  What's more, to the people complain about things being tedious, I'd just accept that this is not your sort of game and that's okay.  It's mine though.  I don't find it tedious at all. 

In Kingdom: New Lands when you went back to your previous islands, you just started again.   Now there's a reason to go back, re-visit upgrade more and to care about them.   it feels like you are making a difference tot he world as you play and that's meaningful and powerful to me.   I loved it.

I'm also not sure what the people complaining about having nothing to do for Winter are talking about.   Did you not plan for winter?   As long as you have a good amount of savings in the bank earning interest and an army of spearmen fishing for you, you'll be quite fine.

And yes, I did encounter a few bugs when playing (once my builders stopped getting in my seige towars and once they stopped building my catapult when the end wall location moved.  In both cases it was easily fixed by exiting and then returning.  There was nothing game breaking. 

I'm still a total completionist so I really wish there was a way -- after you resolve all the islands to go back and unlock everything.   I has a sad about that a bit.   I want stables full of all the mounts!!!   I am sad that I can't have them, even after I finish.

The balance has shifted drastically from older Kingdoms, with totally new waves and more control in the player's hands at how fast the game progresses.  As always it's a joy to watch my kingdom grow as I ride forth.  There is a clearly defined win condition, but I'm unhappy the map progression is not randomized.  You'll always find the same mounts and shrines on the same islands, which can make the game feel repetitive unless purposely rushing an island to play with a different mount or bonus.

It's a cool template and was very enjoyable, but investing a few hours only to have it wiped away due to a game ending bug is just too much.

I've been hooked on these games since Kingdom Classic years ago and Two Crowns takes what New Lands did and turns it up to 11. Multiplayer can add a whole new layer of enjoyment to this game but there's still no shortage of fun to be had even in singleplayer.

The game was a bit buggy at launch however those bugs have been ironed out along with the addition of QoL changes to make the game more enjoyable. Builder AI is also far less stupid than previous Kingdom games which is a godsend.

If you like Kingdom or want a chill tower defense game with gorgeous pixel art and a lovely soundtrack then definitely give this one a buy.",True,1549657519
"So, I loved the original game so much. Right up my alley with tower defense mechanics and a big emphasis on upgrading your base. It is wonderful. So of course I bought this version. And I was so disappointed. My main gripe is the game-breaking bugs. I can tolerate floating archers running past me in the sky, or even stuck animations, or banners randomly disappearing. But there's bugs that can make the builders all of a sudden stop on their project (devastating when they're upgrading your outer wall, the only defense) and you have to EXIT AND RESTART THE GAME to make them start working again. I had to restart the game 2-5 times every time I played because otherwise I would die from bugs.

But the biggest insult? The knight statue. I hated this in the original game, it makes your strongest unit (meant to be a defensive unit) lunge out from safety and attack the monsters. And he will almost always hurt or even kill himself in the process. I tried it once in the original and thanked my lucky stars that the power is on cool down (disappears after a few nights). Now, in this game, it appears late game, and you get excited for it, only to realize it works the same, BUT IT NEVER STOPS. Because it's permanent now. It added so much higher difficulty to my final island because my Samurai warriors kept killing themselves every night. And there was nothing I could do except either win or die. I, like many others, also hate Winter. I played the Samurai team and they have NOTHING to do during Winter. Pray you're ready enough and then just... wait... 

Lastly, I have to express disappointment that there was almost nothing new here. A few things are different from the original but certainly not enough to warrant the price tag if you played the original. If you've not played the original, I would recommend that one because it didn't have the bugs like this one does (at least when I played it). If this ones bugs gets ironed out, sure, play this one. But stay away if you've played the original, or wait for a substantial discount. It's not worth it with this content.",False,1549563086

"PREVIOUSLY DID NOT RECOMMEND.  READ ON
I love the kingdom series.  I adore these games.  I was very excited for a multiplayer version of the game.  Sadly, despite that the engine appears to be identical to the last two installations it is now riddled with game breaking bugs.  I have restarted the game easily over a dozen times due to these wildly obvious bugs that completely and utterly ruin a play-through. Some of these bugs include:

* Unable to load people onto the ships
* Travelling to a new island causes the greed to spawn during the next morning, causing you to lose all of your archers
* The forge never appears (critical for finishing the game)
* Walls never get upgraded and instead collect builders who never move again unless attacked by the greed
* etc., etc., etc.

A frustrating game design decision was to introduce the winter season which takes a very long time to get through while your economy is crippled. This is a bizarre move.

What was the straw that broke the camels back for me was that when I had had enough and logged bugs with the developer, they immediately marked them resolved, closed the tickets and provided no feedback.  That was two updates back and the bugs still exist.

This game is beautiful.  The art is wonderful and the music is very well done, but the the game is, so far in my experience, broken and borderline unbeatable.


UPDATE (More or less in response to the developer response, as I can't respond directly to them - thanks for responding...):
* Regarding going to a new island and greed spawns on the first morning - I've seen it happen a few times.  The last time was after leaving an island at night with the stone lighthouse built.  This was from the third island back to the first.  When I arrived the moon was rising but the archers went out into the fields.  All walls were knocked down and needed repair.  At the start of the morning (as indicated by the day number and the sound of bells) greed came from both sides in broad daylight.  Again, I've had this happen multiple times, the last time was as described above.
* Regarding the forge:  Has also happened several times, and I've given more than enough space for it to spawn.  I've gone from the third wall out from the castle all the way to the dock with iron walls and still no forge.  At times closing/reloading the game makes it spawn, but I've also seen it disappear, move or even convert to a second catapult workshop upon restarting the game.  I'm not sure if the forge exists in the shogun dlc but I've never had it spawn in that...
* Regarding walls never getting upgraded.  The walls get paid for, the scaffold appears,2 builders run to it and proceed to stand in place and play their idle animations.  This happened directly after returning to an island and trying to repair a destroyed wall.  It was a 2nd level wood wall going to a stone wall.
* Winter, I don't recall new lands having a winter that was this difficult or long to get through though it's clearly been a long while since I've played it and I haven't gotten to a winter on the ios version yet.  Still, super difficult, very annoying and boring.  I typically park my monarch by a gate and let the game run until it's over.

YET ANOTHER UPDATE:
It appears I and enough other people reporting the exact same bugs (that were dismissed by the developer previously) has had an impact, as those bugs (that didn't exist) are now fixed.  Furthermore, the mind-numbingly boring winter periods have received a modification where berry bushes appear that can be harvested, so there's now something to do in the winter other than create more villagers.

FINAL UPDATE: 
You can now actually win the game across both campaigns.  Because it's not embarassingly broken, I can now recommend it.  Hurray!",True,1549504973

"I don't review a lot of games, but I feel I need to say something about this one.  Yes, it had bugs upon release, some of which made it more ""challenging,"" (or game ending) but I was still able to beat the game with my original save.  It's not just a rehash of New Lands as they added some pretty cool new features.  I also really enjoyed actually going into the Greed's lair to see what the dev's imagination came up with.  I've had a really fun time playing it, the Shogun skin is pretty cool, and pikemen are a great addition.  All in all, I am glad I purchased it, and I would recommend it to fans of the series.  Those new to the series should probably start with Kingdom: New Lands so they know what this type of game is all about and then graduate to this one.

Also, I have a comment on reviews that I see labeling this game as ""slow.""  It's not an action packed type of adventure, and it is in no way meant to be.  In my opinion, it is meant to all be taken in and the journey is meant to be enjoyed, not just a race to the end.  The music, art, and game play all lend to a more zen style, and I think it is fun to sit back and watch the kingdom (roll credits) you have built do the work for you.  And when it crumbles, it is pretty satisfying to go to the ashes and rebuild.  All in all, I love this series and would recommend this game.

I love the 'Kingdom' series. I've played since the very first version they had on steam. They revamped it and gave all owners a free copy of the revamped game. That's what should have happened for everyone who had Kingdom: New Lands. Whilst I do enjoy the game. There are various unfixed glitches both graphical and game play wise that have been noted by pretty much everyone else. The only positive thing they've added to Two Crowns edition would be the multiplayer and while that is a very welcome addition to the game it's not worth charging $20 bucks for. All they effectively did was enable a multiplayer add-on. I'm not trying to make light of how hard they worked on it and downplay the effort they put forth into the game but the price does not justify what has been added to the base game of 'New Lands'. They should have just added a 5 dollar DLC for multiplayer or something. Instead they re-branded the game with multiplayer enabled and slapped on a higher price tag. That's a pretty scummy practice for a series I once thought to be fair and just.,False,1549313365

"Kingdom Two Crowns is almost buggy beyond words.  Don't get me wrong.  I thoroughly enjoyed Kingdom and Kingdom: New Lands.

The problem is that Kingdom is a slow game.  If an issue occurs twenty hours in then that's twenty hours lost.  And issues will occur.

So far I've had the vagrants (I think they're called beggars now) stop spawning on the first island.  I've often had the knights rally points refuse to accept coins.  I've had a hermit disappear, he was inside the fort at the time.  The forge has not appeared on island five after fully upgrading the keep.  The ship has left without me on island two.

At least two of those are game breaking.  Without the forge it's impossible to build the bomb to destroy the greed.  That was when I embarked to island two in an attempt to hop straight back to island five; only to have the ship leave without me or my dog (but with the hermits).

It's quite frustrating that Kingdom Two Crowns was released in such a mess because I used to find the Kingdom games cathartic.

"This game is awesome. I won't go into too much detail about the game because the beauty of this game is that it throws you in there knowing nothing and the thrill and  excitement you get when you are like ""holy crap you can do that??"" 

There are some things that could use a few tweaks and additional content but the developers have stated they are working on it. I have SO much fun playing this game. I think the problem is that this game isn't classified as a roguelike in which it is similar to something like FTL or dwarf fortress. ""Losing is fun"" is a term with roguelikes and I'm rather annoyed by the whiners who complain about the game and possibly turn people away from this game from their unfair reviews. I'll address the most common complaints.

1) Winter mechanic - This is a part of the strategy to save up and build interest with the banker. If you're really playing the game correctly you should be getting so many coins that you don't know what to do with prior to winter. As in, you have to toss coins out in fear of them falling into the river because you can't carry anymore. As if that wasn't enough, you also have pikemen getting coins for you as well. It's winter! The idea is to prepare for the coming shortage of resources and a part of the strategy. So basically during winter you should be working on non money gathering tasks like taking down portals and setting up your defenses for the counter-attacks. The majority of the time when I focus on that before I even realize it winter is over (assuming you prepared correctly for winter).

2) Content - New Lands was free if you bought the original. Then they came out with two crowns. I read the reviews and felt like it wasn't worth my money based solely on the negative reviews. I eventually bought it because I kept reading about all the new stuff like shogun, smiths, new mounts, new towers, new hermits, in addition to coop! I remember buying the game and I remember seeing the new graphics and animations for the archers and I was in ecstasy because I knew I was only seeing the tip of the iceberg of the new content. Then the new music kicked in, and then I moved around and saw something falling out of the sky. Then I kept going and then I saw the beautiful backgrounds and the statues and I was already thinking this was totally worth the money!

3) People complaining about losing because game mechanics weren't explained? Hey developers: I want you to know I appreciate this. I appreciate this so much I would say this is the whole charm to your game because the fun in this game is just experiencing things and figuring out how stuff works as you play. I appreciate games that it's all based on how you set stuff up. I appreciate games that are difficult that you cannot beat it on the first try and have to re-strategise over and over again. I LOVE roguelikes where losing is fun. The theme of this game is ""Nothing lasts. Many have lost their crown.""

"TWO CROWNS: A DISSERVICE TO KINGDOM

It pains me to have to write a negative review because Kindom: New Lands is excellent. Although I'm sure the devs didn't mean to release this game while it was littered with a dense minefield of game breaking bugs, it's not right and I need to speak up about it.

Kingdom: Two Crowns is the same game as Kingdom: New Lands with some minor alterations and new multiplayer features. It seemed worthwhile to buy this soley for the added local multiplayer option, which I happily threw my money at Raw Fury for, except I didn't at all expect such a sloppy release. 

I experienced easily around 30 bugs, 8 of which were game breaking. Normally, I'd have the mind to get in touch and fill out some bug reports for Raw Fury, but frankly, there are way too many issues and I feel like I should be asking for a refund. 

Notable Bugs

- If you save and quit right after you've filled up your boat and set sail, upon reloading the game your leader and horse will spawn OUTSIDE of the ship. The ship will still be sailing out and you will end up stuck on the island with no other means of leaving it.

- We did not receive the acheivement for completing the game with 1 reign. This was painful because we already had restarted the game from the beginning 3 times before due to other game breaking bugs.

- End Credits music plays on top of the game level music resulting in a cacaphony of discord 

- Archers sometimes spawn floating above ground rendering them useless

Anyway. Conclusion, wait until they release a patch with a good bunch of bugs listed as fixed otherwise you may end up having a frustrating experience. If you REALLY want to play this game then get Kingdom: New Lands and wait until a patch release or two later. 

I hope the folks at Raw Fury are working to fix all these bugs! Releasing a gem like Kingdom: Two Crowns in this atrocious buggy state is really unacceptable, knowing how great this game can be.

"Very good game, wonderful expansion on the previous versions.  I loved the new different play types and the game is worth buying (from my view) for the local coop alone.  We did experience some crazy bugs from time to time, so be aware.  We had one level that never spawned a needed building so, it became impossible to fully-fully complete, but was fun nonetheless.

Update - Wish they would fix the bugs.  Also I take issue with ""full controller support"" when we can't get it to recognize or play with any of our controllers (2 of them are steam controllers).  It used to work, they used to be fine, but now it's keyboard only.  Still beautiful and fun and Kingdom, but they could do some patches to get it back in functional mode.

Another Update - Figured out the controllers issue, more user error than game problem.  I still think it's a great game, but hope they keep working out the bugs.  Local Co-op is still the strongest selling point.",True,1547935209
"There's a few things that I want to say here. And I'm sorry about the length of this review...

First of all, I've loved this game since the first version and it just keeps getting better. The people working on this game are absolutely incredible!

And secondly, pretty much everything in the game works great. The currency system has been polished and has gone from good to fantastic. I sometimes accidentally use up my last coin with no proper income available and I immediately start to panic. But that's when a little deer decides to show up and I end up having 3 coins. Simply having 1 coin is enough to get back on your feet, and if you've played it a while, you might know a way to get rich really quickly, even after having lost just about everything.

But the third and last thing... The one extremely game-breaking enemy in the game. The ""leaper"" or ""crown stealer"" as people seem to call it (which makes perfect sense the moment you encounter it). This leaper is the perfect example of a brilliant idea for an enemy, where the devs screwed up completely. I absolutely love the idea, it's really just that they didn't make it properly... I'll try to explain what I mean.

The first thing that went wrong is the sound. They had a brilliant idea to have it make a sound to warn you that it's coming. The problem is just that the sound is reallly (and I mean like REALLY) low. The first time I heard it, I thought it was a random background noise from one of my workers or something. It truly doesn't sound threatening AT ALL. I've gotten used to the sound of blood moon arriving. That sound is freaking terrifying and even if it's the first time you hear it, you simply just KNOW that something bad is about to happen. But the fact that I didn't even realize that the leaper sound wasn't just a harmless background sound... That truly is just bad game design.

The second problem with the leapers is the speed. Considering how this leaper is an enemy that can litteraly kill you in one hit and even jump over any and all walls you have set up, making the leaper pretty much TWICE as fast as one of the fastest mounts in the game is just horrible... The first time I saw it, I knew that it wasn't just a normal enemy. Of course I immediately ran as fast as I possibly could in the opposite direction. But guess what... IT STILL KILLED ME AFTER 2 FREAKING SECONDS... And on a fast mount too...

The third and biggest problem. This one is the COMPLETELY game-breaking part of the leaper. I had finally figured out the sound, and after looking up strategies online I had archers everywhere (the archers were supposed to easily kill the leaper). Then after a good few really silent squeaks, the leaper finally showed up. I had a perfect defence with only one side the enemy could come from. Guess what... The leaper just ran straight through my defences and immidiately killed me. And what did my 'oh so great' army do to stop the leaper? NOTHING..! QUITE LITERALLY NOTHING..! The straight up just watched me die without doing anything about it. And trust me, they had plenty of opportunities to attack...

In general the game is absolutely amazing. But to be honest, if the devs don't fix this horrible enemy (to make it the brilliant enemy it was supposed to be), I honestly don't think I'll keep playing this for much longer. They failed so much with one single enemy... But if they fix this problem, I would LOVE to play this game a lot more.
I currently have really high hopes that the devs fix this soon (considering how little they need to change), and the reason why I have such high hopes is because I've seen what they have made for this game so far. These devs aren't just average game devs with no real idea of how to make games. They've proven that much beyond any doubt.

So all in all, I still strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy games. The price is definately worth it.
And please note that I have absolutely nothing against the devs. They simply made a mistake that can be corrected. And seeing how there are a good few other bugs at the moment, I'll be patient while waiting for the big game-changing fix.",True,1547925674
"This was one of the better games that I've enjoyed the graphics and artwork the most in, especially for pixel art this game has amazing graphics in it. The detail put into the environment is well done, as well as the abience that follows it and the music used to push a sad but hopeful feeling. The game can be very relaxing without being overly easy, and also has it's tense moments when appropriate for say destroying something or sending out your knights. The animations in the game are also quite good, with walking animations for mounts and other characters being unique based on structure. The gameplay does have a few issues, but definitely worth giving a try at the least.",True,1547893152

"I played the first game until I ran out of stuff to do, then looked up how to reset it so I could start again. I also introduced it to my SO's daughter, who loved it. I was super excited to see the sequel come out, and I have to say, it's pretty awesome.

The mechanics are very similar, with the introduction of a new currency system that fixes a few issues in the first game. The game does feel a little bit like a DLC more than a whole new game, but it IS more of what I enjoy, so I like it. 

Once you figure out the game, you sort of have to make your own challenge out of it. Yes, you can go the super OP route and destroy everything without much effort. You can also choose to go vanilla and see if you can make it all the way without any upgrades. 

I see a lot of talk about bugs, and I have seen a few minor ones, but nothing has affected my gameplay. If you like the original game, definitely give this a try. If you haven't played it before, well...get the original, see if you like it, and get this if you do.",True,1547771902
"I fell in love with Kingdom only a few months back, and only just bought this game, so far I'm immensly enjoying the updated graphics and the new stuff. This is a game that has you worrying about every single coin / gem.

The only nitpick I have is the first island does not give you any gems, yet exploring the island will have a Gryphon encounter, hermit houses and the archery statue.

"[b]Update[/b]
Well, I said I would update the review and true to my word I have come here to do just that. The original review is left in tact for those curious about my old feelings or wonder the nature of the beast in the before days.

A fair warning I still have yet to join in jolly cooperation but I can focus detailing most of the games updates.

First, a lot of bugs that once existed have been fixed. While some were graphical in nature others could affect gameplay. From what I saw in videos and heard a decent amount were in co-op. With the prolonged care and updates post release I assume the co-op experience is likely better in general even before looking at gameplay.

Second, the game play has been vastly improved in small ways. Gems were quite a burden on the players bag. Some upgrades were simply not worth it or redundant, like unlocking every mount or buying the knight statue, but for anything deemed necessary you'd need to carry some to purchase upgrades. This could mean little space for coins to upgrade walls or whatever else. And when coins don't fit in your bag they could land in the river and you'd just be out the money. Thankfully you can now store gems away that you don't have use for.

The other big game change was Winter. Somewhat of a game over mechanic from a previous title here it had little function save to slow the gameplay loop. Your coin generation would drop to near nothing. This meant normal kingdom actions like building the boat or expanding and building up stronger walls could be done a lot less and the time period was 16 in game days. Farmers couldn't farm and would toss the expensive scythes into the river. And if you went to a new island winter would be there too. You'd have whatever you brought in your bag to build defenses and then have to last the remaining days before you'd see any new gold which could be potentially game ending depending on the day. Basically you could be stuck doing very little over a long period. Now however there are winter berry bushes that farmers can harvest from and while small game has vanished from lands there is a deadly boar that monarchs can aim to hunt. Winter now has some amount of gameplay to it.

For any veterans the game might still take some getting used to but it is certainly better than where it started. I still recommend checking out ""Kingdom New Lands"" as I personally do prefer that more and think it superior but ""Kingdom Two Crowns"" can be a fun experience as well.

Additional update, I've played some of co-op and it is very buggy still. Not too many things past annoying tedium. Like having to reload the game to fix an issue or to get buildings to spawn. Amazing the number of times it came up and thankfully it is a simple enough fix. Just a bit time consuming. But for any patient players there is a lot of fun to be had having a friend along for the ride.

[b]Original Review[/b]
Kingdom has been a beloved series for me. First I'll say the game does have things in it that, for me, are just aesthetically pleasing. The art and sounds/music have been lovely in that regard but more than just that personal love these were games that you could play like a science. The rules were simple enough. Player interaction mostly coming from how you spend your money. Hiring hunters or builders, chopping down trees, building farms or walls, and even outside of the spending mechanic sometimes just dropping coins down as greed's gift to go away that night. It all came together neatly and made for an interesting player experience. You were always able to do something and be playing the game. Even waiting at a wall to defend could be crucial if you needed to give money away to save your kingdom.

Sad to say in Kingdom two crowns I have not found the same joy. A few mechanics are a bit more complex and older systems were replaced or changed, and some interactions are not immediately clear like they were in previous titles. And the big positive change being the option of playing Kingdom with a friend doesn't fully outweigh these negatives. Some change you can get used to but these changes have made the game worse in my eyes. My opinion aside the gameplay flow is vastly different as a result of these changes. There are talks of quality of life updates and I'll try to update my review, depending on what all changes, (Winter being a boring 15 days makes me pause and question if I should invite a friend along) but for now my recommendation is a soft no. As a fan of ""Kingdom New Lands"" my advice is buy that instead of ""Kingdom Two Crowns"". Much more enjoyable experience and better music as well.",True,1547521166
"Some nice new additions from the last game though I'm not sure why they kept the same issues that plagued the last game including balance issues, lack of control, and it's kinda slow and boring much of the time.

"Hi! If you are reading through these reviews then you must be deciding if you should buy this wonderful game or not you may be like me and have played new lands and completed it or you saw a youtuber play it and didnt know about the price tag but whatever boat you have found yourself in, if you are a fan of the series coming back one last time or a newbie gettin ginto kingdom i would highly recommend this game for:

. Amazing Graphics
. Beautifully composed soundtrack
. THE ABILITY TO COMPLETLY WIPE GREED FROM AN ISLAND
. A well thought out progression system that is easy to learn without tutorials or annoying announcers
. You are able to go back to islands you have been to before and build a lighthouse so your boat does not crash
. Two modes are currently in the game: ""Regular and Shogun"" the difference being that shogun changes up the artstyle and music to fit a more japanses asthetic while keeping the kingdom feel to it
. Your walls appear in the background unlike in new lands where the background is just grass

. ""This one is for returning players so if u r new skip dis =)"" In new lands you had wood and then stone and now in two crowns you have Wood, Stone and METAL this allows you to upgrade your walls to be stronger and your archer towers to hold 4 people while be protected form floaters trying to eat them which is useful when bloodmoons are happening lots due to portal destruction. Another thing to do with this is upgrade your knights which in this game start off as ""Squires"" into proper shielded armoured KNIGHTS that will help you get a very fun and explosive ending=)))

"I've been a huge fan of the series and have put a ton of hours into classic and newlands, but with this game you're essentially buying the same game with a few addons. Playing in Shogun mode is cool and different, but doesn't dramatically change play style or tactics. My largest complaint is the sheer amount of bugs I've dealt with: Seasons not rendering correctly, backgrounds not changing, villagers getting stuck between walls. I'm also disappointed with a few game mechanics, the game doesn't seem balanced at points. The enemy goes from being really easy to getting out of hand at points. changing Islands in the middle of winter is a nearly instant death. Its really hard to generate any income so you're essentially just waiting for spring. I can deal with this, but due to the bugs I've encountered overall I would not reccommend this game at least until they make a more stable version.",False,1547342445
"This game is still worthwhile for fans of the series. I loved New Lands. I do, however, agree with the sentiment that not a whole lot  of new features were added to this game. Farms are less useful in this iteration due to the increased amount of buildings needed in your land (closer buildings reduce the amount of tillable land around a farm). So you have a spearman/ninja hut, and a forge impeding on the usefulness of your farms. They're often not even worth the investment for the time required to blow up the cave. The cave and the spear/ninja hut are great additions, but change the previous mechanics quite a bit. 

My first recommendation would be to move the hermits to a different area than central town. Sure they could go there at night, but in the day it would be great to be able to not have to worry about minute changes in your horse's position in order to upgrade your castle/recruit squires and knights. I've lost 3 hermits so far because they hopped on my dang horse when all I wanted was to hire a squire. Then they hop off at night and don't run from the greed! Outside walls! It's infuriating. I don't mind this as long as 

There are a lot of complaints regarding  winter that I completely agree with. I will usually just afk during winter and hope my settlement makes it through. Not very compelling gameplay. Perhaps they could add a new hermit who allows for a greenhouse to be built as a third upgrade for farms? Greenhouses would work in winter. Maybe it only allows for 3 tillable spaces beneath the glass? Still allowing 6 (potential, ugh) plots for the summer/spring,  Anything, anything to allow for more activity during winter season. Heck maybe you wouldn't even need a hermit. Maybe even include a mini game where you have to smack winter greed off your greenhouses every couple nights. Or if you want to stick with the spirit of the game where you passively manage things then have ninjas and spearmand protect greenhouses. Just suggestions, hope the developers are also thinking of these kinds of improvements. 

I'm still gonna give it a recommend! But I hope they make some fixes in an update or expansion.",True,1547339228

2019 Review:
Huge fan of the series, I have replayed New Lands and Classic more times than I can count, but unfortunately the latest chapter isn't quite ready for play. As numerous have people have commented, winters range from tedious to an instant lose situation (starting a new island in winter makes no sense). Also, though gems are an interesting idea that brings more inventory management to the game, bankers should be able to take at least some of the gems since they take up a huge part of the bag. Permadeath is gone, which I am torn on, but losing all your gems means you might as well be dead so why they bothered to change the system is a mystery. Lots of bugs (ranging from new islands sometimes starting the day counter from the previous island while other times it resets, to characters not doing anything or worse yet townspeople throwing their gear into the water?!). The game unfortunately is a bit of a mess right now. Two Crowns isn't all that different from the original game, some minor graphic tweaks and a few new objects to interact with, so if you are interested in exploring what Kingdom has to offer try playing New Lands. You won't regret it. Wait till a few major updates are released though before buying Two Crowns. Given time it will be a good game.",True,1547314903
"Kingdom New Lands is my favorite game but this one is unplayable. Bugs are eveywhere, from freeze to gameplay problems, which makes it for a terrible experience. Almost nothing works as intended, from bombs to Shogun to knights to deers to camps to deaths to archers to boring winters to farms to builders moving everywhere to farmers not farming to slow-down to difficulty (way too easy on blood moons and way too hard sometimes after destroying a portal - but sometimes only).

"The latest installment of the very charming Kingdom series brings some new and interesting mechanics into the game and also local split screen coop and online multiplayer mode too (with your Steam friends not with random people).
If you have played the former parts, you will not encounter difficulties with this new game. If this is your first Kingdom game, then you will find here many happy hours as you try to discover the hidden mechanisms of the game. 
It is a peaceful game with beautiful music. I love it.
The base of the game is simple - you are a king or queen, you ride your land left and right and pay coins to hire men and make them work or fight. You have to defend your land against greedy monsters and ultimately you should destroy them across five islands. This concept, though, hides a surprisingly intricate and deep game, which constantly makes you marvel at the magical creativity contained in it. You can play the game in a medieval or in a shogun biome - not just simple skin changes, there are some different mechanics between these biomes too. More biomes are planned.
Besides the main campaign, there are also the so-called challenge islands, which are different gamemodes with specified objects, like you try to survive for a certain time, or to protect a wolf cub.

There are some major flaws in this game. I will make you aware of them but for me personally they don't make me want to quit the game. Immediately. First things first, winter is coming is an actual threat in this game. You will have absolutely nothing to do. Go on, make yourself a nice coffee, prepare your own Ted Talk or even just take a  shit . The game will wait for you. You can never prepare for winter enough. With enough money you may be able to build a single wall. Or even more exiting - catch a few fish. Just prepare to be bored. Every other season has some fun gameplay elements and you will have lots of things to do during the day. In winter though the only thing that will really kill you is boredom.
There also still are some bugs in this game. Gold mysteriously disappears. You can't see a mount or two. Sometimes your own people will just fly somewhere and it can happen that you bows, hammers and so on will just disappear. I personally sincerely hope that they will fix this. Is it worth it's money in it's current state? No. Wait for a sale.

- Archers stop shooting, just stand behind the wall while the greed attack
- Bread disappearing (without being eaten)
- Grass appears green in winter when you just load a game and goes back to wintery in a few minutes

"Absolutely spectacular.

I've always been intruiged by kingdoms, but didn't buy new lands until a month ago. With two crowns now out, this is one of my favorite games! The move away from rougue like is definitely what this game needed to become more than a passtime for an hour. The new biome is absolutely beautiful. In fact the entire game is looking better than ever. The new subjects are perfectly balanced. The music is amazing as well. Just everything has got me so worked up, I love this game so much!

I of course do have one complaint. That being the winter. I don't need to say too much about it as everyone else has. But I usually play on the side, not giving it my full attention. This is a chill out game not a super intense one, so despite having sat through 4 winters already, i've not minded so much.

As for the new currency (the gems) I am pretty indifferent. Most people seem to not realise that you can in fact recover lost gems. Not only is it possible to unlock everything (even after dying while holding gems) but in theory, you could finish the game without unlocking anything, as the stone and iron mines do not require gems, and iron is all that is required to defeat the greed. When you blow up the cave on an island you have lost gems on (or hermits and your dog if applicable) you also get back your lost gems. However it has been mentioned that it might not give back 100% of your gems 100% of the time, though I can't confirm yet.

Lastly, on the subject of glitches. I have not experienced any glitches aside from one small graphical glitch where when loading a file, an archer might be floating next to their tower. This is fixed instantly, and I have not experienced anything else. It seems like any of the glitches people were complaining about at launch have been fixed.",True,1546900516
"I bought this game on release and I've so far enjoyed most of the content. You play as a monarch of your choosing, a King or Queen, and you must build and invest your castles and travel from island to island unlocking new upgrades as you go. 

The game play is fairly simple consisting of left and right while you collect coins. The coins are used for a variety of things from upgrading your camp to a fort, to hiring hobos, to buying upgrades/mounts, and building towers and walls.

The actual gameplay mechanics are [i]VERY[/i] obscure. In fact, it's non existent as it never tells you how to play the game much less how the controls are supposed to work. This is largely due in part that the User Experience design is just AWFUL. Just trying to initiate split-screen multiplayer took me an [i]hour[/i] until I had to ask the developers on how to do it (press H, J, or K). Not to mention that using your mounts special abilties are tied to Left Shift(player1) or G(player2) respectively, but no where in the game does it tell you that.

The pacing of the game is what you make of it. You can be fairly busy running back and forth, or you can take your time and admire the well-done music and pixel art of the game. However, the pacing of the game crawls to a halt during the game's winter season and this is largely impacted whether or not you chose to be a European monarch or a Japanese monarch. Winter seasons halt all income from hunting and farming as a gameplay mechanic and it's supposed to make your mistakes costly. When you are set up correctly, you can just camp in your base without fear of reprise from the game's enemies. As a European monarch, you get pikemen who will fish for you during all seasons which will give you income. It's not a lot, but it does help move the game and your defenses a long. Being a Japanese monarch, you get nothing and you're left sitting in your castle for a VERY LONG TIME until winter passes which can last anywhere between 1-2 hours of game time.

Speaking of which, the European and Japanese monarchs are almost identical in terms of gameplay. The only difference are the biomes, the ninja/pikemen, and the aesthetics.

I understand that the devs wanted players to discover things on their own, but some of the design decisions on their game contradicts what should make a game fun and the terrible UX design is a big culprit. The game is playable and it is fun until you run into those few gripes I mentioned and then it becomes painfully unfun until the winter is over.

Is it worth the money? For me, it's a sound yes. I got my $1.00/Hour ratio satisfied and I imagine playing it more when the devs balance out the game in the future with better QoL updates.",True,1546885502

When I started playing Kingdom Two Crowns with a friend of mine, I was quite intrigued. The game has a sense of simplicity and mystery about it. It has an extremely simple control scheme: You move left and right with the arrow keys, and hold ""down"" to invest collected gold to build structures and tools or recruit citizens to expand your kingdom - that's it. You'll only get minimal direction as well: you're initially shown how to build a campfire, walls, recruit new citizens, and assign those citizens roles as archers or builders, but that's it. 

There is a sense of mystery about the game, and you may often have exciting discoveries. In the first map, there was a bird that crashed into the surrounding land. In another map, I found that I could replace my starting horse with a majestic stag that seemed to impress all of the female deer in the land. We were shocked to find that we were able to construct a catapult at one point in the game, and were excited to see it in action.

The best thing about the title is the presentation. The player's viewpoint during the entire game is 2D, with what is happening in the settlement reflected in the water below. The pixelated graphics are very charming and surprisingly detailed, with fish jumping about in the water and distinct types of trees populating the game's forests. The music is superb and atmospheric sound effects immerse the player, such as the crackling of the campfire or the clanging of pots and pans.

Although initially the simplicity of the control scheme is a bonus, I began to get irritated with it as we continued. You can't redirect the citizens you've recruited, so they may prioritize building incorrectly, neglect taking positions in archer towers, or refrain from hunting rabbits to earn you coins when you need them most. Sometimes they will walk slowly and get murdered by the ""Greed"" (the enemy force in the game) at night when they attack, even when it seems that they could've easily escaped behind your settlement walls. In addition, I wish that I could sell buildings that I'd created earlier. It was usually a bonus to build archer towers when initially creating a settlement, but as you expand your settlement out, your walls expand as well. Eventually, you'll find yourself with archers sitting in towers close to the center of your settlement that have no chance of helping you against an attack.

So, so many things could be explained better to the player. When you go through the woods, the screen becomes darker to reflect the fact that you're in the trees. However, this effect camouflages how late in the day it is. So, sometimes I thought I was safe, but would then be surprised by the attacking Greed force. Perhaps a meter could show on screen how far through the day it is. After upgrading your main camp a few times, you'll have a little fellow with a book. I've since learned that he's a banker who can help your coins gain interest, but the entire time I played I thought he was some sort of priest who took our money to develop his little church. Later, I added a shield to my main fortress by spending four coins. A citizen came up and grabbed the shield, along with a mace. He then proceeded to do nothing but walk back and forth in my base. I later learned (through looking at a guide) that he has some sort of archer contingent that he can escort around? Another much-needed addition would be a little table in the upper right or left of the screen that tells you how many citizens you have of each type (farmers, archers, builders, etc.). Often, you'll see a citizen trudging through the settlement that was mauled outside with no clue as to what role you'd lost.

Our game came to an end once we reached the third island. Our second island had completely run out of citizens (or at least, we couldn't find any on the map) and we had no builders. This is another issue - I would love to be able to change the role of a citizen, or tell a citizen which tool to pick up if multiple are available. We left on the boat to the third island only with a couple builders. We would've loved to have archers, but we couldn't find any more citizens and many of our archers were glued to posts. When we reached the third island, we were quickly decimated by the somewhat-advanced Greed force (already sending multiple minions wearing masks), and our crowns were destroyed.

However, at this point the game had already lost quite a bit of momentum. The discoveries were fewer and far between, and the vast majority of our time was spent simply managing the stamina for our mounts. As your settlement becomes wider and wider, you'll need to travel from one side of the map to the other over and over again. Unfortunately, when your mount is out of gas, it has to huff and puff for quite a while before regaining its wind.

Kingdom Two Crowns is kind of a game in crisis. It wants to be minimalist and beautiful, but without giving more options to the player and providing more information, it just ends up being frustrating. I'm sure that there is a way to maintain the sense of discovery and mystery that we felt when exploring the maps without making the game as a whole so obtuse. I'm sure that if you were a King, your citizens would likely make mistakes like getting their weapons stolen or repairing the wrong thing, or wandering around in the settlement while rabbits wildly multiplied outside. Perhaps the game is attempting to reflect this? However, I kept thinking to myself: what would be lost if I could simply select a builder and tell him what to work on? Or move an additional archer to the side of the settlement without a catapult? In short, I don't think that achieving the minimalist design is worth sacrificing gameplay.",False,1546737324

The game is designed to be played multiple times. The game is designed to be discovered as you play. If you really want to 'cheat', there are wikis.

tl;dr: Winter makes the game boring, losing gems screws you over, insta-kill monsters that only target you and are faster than you

Firstly, as many others have already pointed out, winter is poorly implemented. It's not as big of a deal as some people are saying, but it does make the game become tedious and somewhat boring. During winter, 2 significant things happen: deer and rabbits stop spawning and your crops die. That means that your archers can't hunt and your farmers can't farm, which leaves you with only two sources of income: hiring pikemen to fish, which only provides you with a slow trickle of coins, and using money stored up in the bank, which is only viable if you have tons of money stored in the first place. If you only have a small amount saved, the interest will likely be neglible and you'll run out of money. Even if you have a lot saved, the interest is capped at 8 coins per day, so if you use more than 8 coins in a day you're still losing money, and the seasons are decently long. Basically you have a very limited income during this whole time and can't do much expansion/upkeep. On a well-developed island winter doesn't do much besides make you bored, but if you decide to travel back to a less-developed island during winter or right before winter begins it can be game-breaking.

Secondly, gems, which are extremely important, can only be found in gem chests (which are 1-time use) and can only be stored in your pouch. You need gems to unlock all the most important items in the game: mounts, hermits, and statues. Because they can only be stored in your pouch, if you die you lose them and there's no way to get them back. So even though there's no permadeath, if you lose enough gems your game is as good as over and you may as well restart.

Thirdly, there are insta-kill monsters that only target you and immediately take your crown, regardless of how many coins/gems you have on you. They also are faster than you, so you can't outrun them, they can jump over walls, and they can even attack you during the day. You won't run into them until late game, but they are a great way to lose a ton of progress, your gems, and have to start back at your decayed first island.",True,1546410371

"I never leave reviews, but I've been in love with the entire kingdom series from the start. The developer is amazing and even gave the second version away for free to people who purchased the first. I just stumbled upon it one day and fell in love with the game all over again.

This particular iteration is awesome, it adds a little complexity while maintaining everything that made this game great. The intriduction of new biomes adds new spice and I can't wait to see what they add next.

Seriously, buy this game. It has more than quadrupled it's worth for me and I couldn't recommend it enough. I wish the developers would add a ""give us money"" option, I just want the games to keep flowing.

"Edit: With the fixes I feel that I can recommend this game however be aware that there are still some bugs (although those that remain are not game breaking). The bugs that remain include: 
1) Whenever I start up the game after saving and quitting during winter (it may happen during the other seasons but it's most noticeable during winter) I get a few minutes of spring/summer with grass on the ground around my ruler. 
2) When returning to an island the army (and the farmers) will walk/run from the starting camp/castle to their respective posts - including any archers in towers which will air run the distance.
3) Occasionally with the new update and the presence of the berry bushes I find that my farmers will stand around and just not leave the berry bushes to run back into town when night falls. (The running all the way back to the main camp can be annoying but it's the only thing preventing the farmers from being wiped out so I can live with it.)
4) In multiplayer games hosted by my friends I get amusing glitches relating to her moving her ruler around - sometimes her mount moves in reverse (facing away from the direction she's running) and sometimes it hick-ups repeatedly causing her mount to look like it's doing some crazy short hops.
5) A more problematic glitch in the multiplayer is sometimes I get eternal darkness so I can't tell what time of day it is and have to actually ask my friend where the sun's position is for planning purposes. 
6) Another problematic glitch I've encountered in the multiplayer setting is that the defensive capabilities of the warhorse (which I tend to ride) are less effective or nullified so when I give the workers/archers/knights the defensive boost and they get hit by the greed they still lose their tool/weapon/coins.


Original review: I really want to recommend this game given that I love how the rest of the series plays and this plays like that but with more improvements (adding that the seasons actually rotates rather than going to endless winter like it did in New Lands and that the Greed can be defeated on islands permanently). However I don't feel right recommending it right now given the number of bugs that I keep encountering. I will change my recommendation when the bugs are ironed out - and it does sound as though a number of these bugs are planned to be fixed early this year.

1) Whenever I start up the game after saving and quitting during winter (it may happen during the other seasons but it's most noticeable during winter) I get a few minutes of spring/summer with grass on the ground around my ruler. 
2) When returning to an island the army (and the farmers) will walk/run from the starting camp/castle to their respective posts - including any archers in towers which will air run the distance.
3) I cannot reliably get the forge to appear in my shogun save game. It took 5-6 repeated returns to island 2 to get it to show up so I could defeat the Greed. And I still haven't been able to get it to show up on on my island 3.
4) On island 3 (the same shogun save game) I since prior to defeating the greed I haven't been able to get any new vagrants to spawn.
5) On island 2 of my shogun save game I had lots of problems with getting my army/support for the bomb to show up and escort it. I had to save and exit several times to get the army to go with it and suddenly the one worker I had that was escorting it walked away - the bomb still moved towards the greed portal when I'd walk but there were no workers pushing it.",True,1546369788
"Bought and completed in one shameful sitting, overall the game feels fair other than the 5th island (although that may be just to me not knowing how to deal with them) which will spawn floaters upon floaters (enemies that fly over your defenses and nab your guys) which if they don't game over you right there, via taking all your archers or builder mounted defenses, then they make it pretty hard to recover afterwards. (I should add that there are towers that protect the archers in them from being grabbed, but even with 4-5 of these on one side it still feels like a few too many floaters, compared to the difficulty curve of the rest of the game). Overall however a really fun game, if not a little frustrating near the end/final stages.",True,1546364046
"i really like the game, and im excited for more expansions",True,1546326459
"This is a great sequel to the previous two Kingdom games. I see the new addition of gems into the game play as a positive one. Sure, them being limited in quantity means if you lose them, you basically have to start from scratch and that is infuriating. But the upgrades you get with them being permanent is a big improvement. There is now a more realistic and forgiving season system (4 seasons and they all last an equal length of time) and I also see that as a positive. Instead of winter being an unforgiving factor that will force you off whatever island you are on and kick you while you're down if you stumble, it is a challenging, survivable season that can be toughed through. The co-op is such an absolutely welcome improvement and was extremely well implemented. As part of the franchise and a great co-op game, I definitely recommend it.",True,1546317279

"I have to say, this game is actually pretty good at first, unfortunately there was A LOT of buggy issues. It's literally making me not want to play it anymore. Sure the few times closing it out to reset the game. BUT HONESTLY I had to do it more than 3 times. 
For instance, I was not able to buy things or upgrades anything, the only way I could do so, is if I reset the hecking game.  Sometimes the game will just crash and I'll lose everything. This game should not be 20 dollars. Should be 5 dollars with all the issues it has with this. 
Especially there are times I can not even open the game and it's just endlessly get stuck on the loading screen.

"Original ""Not Recommended"" review::
I loved the first Kingdom so I was being very patient with this issues in this game, but the problems kept piling up and I'm not having fun. The mid-to-late game is ruined by balance issues and bugs. I had high hopes for what could be done moving forward from the original Kingdom game, but even the janky npc AI from the first game doesn't seem to have been improved a bit.
I requested a refund, but since these issues weren't major until mid game, I might have too much play time. If I do get a refund, I'd consider buying the game again after the game is patched adequately.

Update: I didn't get a refund but I've checked back in with the game, and some issues are being fixed. There's still some annoying bugs but it's definitely improving. I'm standing by my ""don't recommend"" review in general. If you loved the first game, you'll probably be satisfied with what's going on with it now.

"Easy to understand, simple yet addicting city building/ management game that gets progressively harder with more mechanics being introduced the further you go. Game has good soundtrack and the graphics are simple.",True,1546228656
"Pros:
#1, Beautiful Art Style. While many games boast a pixel art style, few are even close to being as relaxing to look at, or as fluid with their motions.

#2, Wonderful Music, while the variety of songs, is lacking, and even the number of them can probably counted on one hand, what it has, is wonderful. 

#3, Great Game Idea. The idea of a 1d game, gathering resources, units, and building structures, in a beautiful pixel art style is great! 



Cons:
#1 issue, Pacing. The game is WAY too slow. Walking, fighting, earning money, building, all of it is at a snail's pace- except for when you get attacked, then things move too fast for their own good. Overall, it feels like it is a mobile game.

#2 Issue, Price. For as simple as this game is, and as poorly thought out it is, it's too expensive, 15$ too expensive.)

#3 Issue. Unit Command. Or, lack of. The game has 4 buttons. Left, Right, Drop/Interact & Sprint.
You cannot command the majority of your units, they act completely on their own, leaving you to plan ahead. Meaning don't start building too close to nightfall, or your units will be outside your walls when the sun goes down. Meaning you can't order units to retreat when a wall is about to fall. Meaning the cute dog the game gives you, might decide to sit outside the walls, AND GET GRABBED!
In theory, it should be cool. But mixed with the game's mind-numbingly slow speed, and it's cookie clicker vibes, it just ends up being boring, and, even worse, stressful. Just let me tell my troops to fall back, just let me order specific units to do things, like any good RTS. In the end, it doesn't feel like a game design choice, but something born out of laziness. (Even though I'm fairly sure it was a choice, it comes across as this)

#4 Issue. Game Design. Much of what I have just said ties into this. The slow pacing, the annoying ally AI, but the game is also brutal. Not in a fair way either, in a instant loss from an enemy you can't fight, nor outrun, but must slow with walls, till one of your ever incompetent AI buddies saves you. This issue also appears after you destroy enemy portals. Which, the game does a horrible job at explaining how, and can glitch out if you have built a boat. 
Example: You can tell units you have built to attack a portal, by putting coins into a flag. Unfortunately, if you also have already repaired your boat, or arrived at this island while you have a lighthouse standing, and therefore the boat wasn't destroyed- your AI attackers, will gleefully march their expensive armor clad asses straight into the boat, away from your portals. 
The game is full of issues caused by indirect control over your units, things, that would have been simply avoided, with a little bit more forethought being put into the game's design.

#5 Issue. Defeat. If you are defeated, you lose your crown. (Which happens incredibly easily) You are sent back to the first island, with your boat (way of getting between islands) destroyed. This is annoying enough, as it requires you to rebuild it to leave the island again. Unfortunately, the great majority of units you left on any island, including islands you have completely secured, will have had their roles stripped from them.
This means, before you can even rebuild your boat, and get back to what you were doing on a different island, you will have to wait for resources to accrue, rebuild your workers, gain more resources, then rebuild your boat.

#6 Issue. Island hopping. While the game allows you to travel between islands, once you arrive at any island, your boat is destroyed. Rebuilding this boat, becomes more difficult the higher difficulty the island is. This isn't by a new resource, new workers, or any sort of complex mechanic, merely the need of more coins. This can be prevented once you have conquered the dock side of the island, and built a lighthouse. After this point, you will be able to return to the island without issue.... until the game decides it wants to arbitrarily punish you, by destroying your tower while you were away, causing you o need to rebuild your ship again, once you visit a already secure island.



Writeup:
This game sucked me in, with it's beautiful art style, and apparently easy gameplay. Something I thought would be a bit of fun, maybe I would get through it's 5 islands in 5-10 hours.
It took me about 39, and the only reason I finished this game, was because of some unexplainable urge to finish it, to see it to the end. Like when you watch a movie you were sure was going to be good, that, even looks like it should be good while you are watching it- but, is absolutely horrible. You still have to see it to the end. That, is what this game has been to me. Stressful, poorly thought out, way too expensive, and way way too slow. I highly recommend avoiding this game, unless you have more free time on your hands, than an eternal trapped in a cryo-tube.

"The amount of infuriating bugs and the crownstealer is enough for anyone to just give up. Worse yet is how senselessly people seem to defend the game when you point out these bugs. https://steamcommunity.com/app/701160/discussions/0/1743355067122979244/

While this game is fun to play, as a new player to the kingdom serious, the number of game breaking bugs such as the one’s I’ve described in that forum is enough to say the right now this game is not with the £16. To make it easier, I’ve reposted the list below

1 the baker bug which is a thing everyone has experienced where the bread at the baker just keeps disappearing and doesn’t attract vagrants.
2 host building a baker and every workers hammer making my ears bleed my playing the finished building sound effect.
3 not being able to ride a certain mount in there game, even though host could and I could ride other mounts (the lizard)
4 unicorn not being able to pick up the gold has coop player as when you turn around, the coins teleport behind you again and further away from you torturing you as you are unable to pick up the gold yourself and need the host or a villager to pick it up for you
5 the unicorn changing skins from shogun to vanilla after logging off and back on.
6 a blood moon happening and then your whole village stays in night mode so you can no longer make any money and then have to quit and start all over again.
7 a crownstealer spawning in the middle of *ucking day and one shot killing you and having to restart the whole damn game all over again.

It currently has some quite annoying bugs, but those which i have encountered have been easy to fix just by closing and reopening the game (which for me took like 10 seconds). still those are things that are annoying.

Many people are complaining about the AI on the game and yes sometimes it is frustrating how workers are outside the walls and you try to save them. This same thing also brings some strategy to the game (I.e. if you pay workers to cut down trees just before night time, you could have avoided that by being smart and not paying the literally when night is starting.)
It's for not for everyone and sometimes it is absolutely the games fault.

Still it's a good game and when they fix the bugs it will be a lot better. But the ''bugs'' about workers suiciding are often cause by the player themself.

More enjoyable now, though if you already have New Lands, I don't know that I'd recommend getting this one. If this is your first time in this series, then I'd probably get it, especially if on sale! :)


Old Review: Was a big fan of New Lands(played 144 hours and thinking of going back to that one). Love the new ideas in this game, but the numerous bugs are currently killing my enjoyment. Managed to make it to the fourth island and then back to build up the first island more before winter kicked in. I've lost track of the number of days that I've been stuck in winter now. At least 20 I believe. This may be normal, or a bug, I'm not sure. The farmers threw away their scythes after about 10 days of winter. Made some sense in New Lands as once winter kicked in, it never ended. This game is supposed to have the seasons cycle back through though, so why have them chuck them? Whether this is a bug or intentional, please change this as it's very frustrating to see 8 farmers chuck their tools that cost 4 coins a piece!

As for the full on bugs that have killed my current game, the 15+ archers at the wall on the cliff side suddenly decided to stop defending and won't fire at all (dock side is safe). So of course my outer iron wall fell. After somewhat surviving that, and paying to rebuild the wall with my remaining money (winter dregs), the builders rebuilt it to just before it would actually exist again then stopped. So I'm basically screwed at this point with no boat (was going to wait till after winter), and broken defences....

Can't recommend this game till the numerous bugs get patched...",True,1546006324
"1st playthrough
Lose my crown on the 3rd island because I tried to save my builders after they deforested far away from the wall but not enough coins to feed the greed. From 1st playthrough, I realise that gem is finite. Once you lose it, you lose it forever. Scared that the lost gems will affect my progress so I restarted the game. So far, I enjoyed the game.

2nd playthrough
1st, 2nd, 3rd island - build lighthouse, destroy all the greed portals. From this playthrough, I learnt that ninja is lousy as AF. The moment I want to depart to 4th island, it started to snow. I thought that season would restart after I travelled to new island but I was wrong. With little coins, I quickly built up decent defence and hoping that the winter would end after few days. After 5 days, the winter hadn't end. With no income and the greeds were getting stronger and stronger day by day. Stop playing and did some researches on Internet. Realising I fucked this playthrough the moment I departed to new island on the 1st day of winter. Is ok, never mind. For now, I will stop playing shogun dlc as ninja is useless. 

3rd playthrough
1st island - build decent defence ASAP. Realising the most archers were staying inside the walls instead of going outside the clear patch of grassland. Income was bad but I managed to get to 2nd island ASAP as the wrecked ship was near my base. 
2nd island - again, most archers just stayed inside the wall. Luckily my wrecked ship was near the base. Clear the path to the dock, built the lighttower and repaired the ship. My joy for the game was starting to diminish as the economic was bad. I didn't even know whether I had enough coins in the bank once I came back from 4th island after unlocking iron technology. It would probably be winter - boring and no income period. Departed to 3rd island after getting 8 pikemen.
3rd island - so far so good, until I destroyed the 1st greed portal to the dock. The archers and pikemen just gathered at the wall for continuous 3 days and no greeds at all. 

That's it. The game is not playable.

Updated - 9/9/2019
Still try to play this game. Everything was fine until I got a catapult. I don't know what happens - the catapult just moved out of the wall protection and moved straight towards the enemy. Trying to save my catapult by sending my knight but was destroyed by overwhelming enemy. Still not playable.

Updated - 9/11/2019
Before this, managed to beat the game despite a lot of bugs. After months of not playing this game, I heard that there is a new update for this game. Give it a try. I really love the challenge. Hence, I will recommend this game. Not sure bout bugs but till now, I encounter no bugs. Awesome game. 
In the 2nd game of today, gave shogun a try. Although ninja was buffed, ninja was still lousy. It could take more blows but when it comes to higher end enemies, it couldn't even deal any damage to them.

"In short, this is a nice game. However in its current state, I cannot recommend due to some issues with the gameplay, and a few game breaking bugs. I'll write a proper review once stuff gets sorted out.

One of the game breaking bugs is, sometimes, when you load a save, all of your subjects will be reset, and start moving to the walls from the town center. The problem with this is, the next enemy wave will wreck everything in its path as your defenses are not where they are supposed to be. 

The other game breaking bug is, if a ship is ready to sail, attack orders will redirect your forward units to the ship. If you weren't paying attention, this will result in one side being unable to attack, unless you travel to another island and come back. While this can be avoided, this shouldn't have been the case at all.

One of the gameplay issues I'm having is with the new Leaper units of greed. These can knock your crown off no matter what you are carrying, and there is no escaping them. If you get caught outside your walls, it's game over for that session. Even when you think you are safe, as they can leap over the walls, one can still get to you as it happened to me once while I was next to the town center. And I've noticed that these units sometimes spawn in broad daylight, and sometimes out of nowhere. In my opinion, these fast units require immediate rebalancing.

And the other gameplay issue is, the Knight shrine is badly designed. Knights gain the ability to charge, however the problem is they keep doing it even when defending behind a wall, leaving themselves exposed, and possibly leading to loss of equipment. If there is a wall in front of them, they shouldn't charge at all. 

All in all, I appreciate a continuous journey compared to the previous titles, however the roguelike nature of the game (one life rule, in a way) combined with the length of one life leads to immense frustration as some poorly implemented features and a few game breaking bugs wreck your 5+ hour game in an instant. I'll change my review when these issues / bugs are sorted out as I enjoyed the game as is, but at the end of the day, it left a bitter taste in my mouth.",False,1545947873

"There are a lot of things about this game that are big improvements on the original; the change from perma death to a heavily penalized death and the addition of co-op being the most notable; but two new mechanics absolutely RUIN the game:

The first is winter-
I'm not opposed to the idea of a seasonal change mechanic, but the impilmentation at the moment is horrible. When winter comes around, your crops (the primary means of income) die, animals that your archers hunt (your secondary means of income) despawn, and grass patches (which allow you to regenerate your mount's stamina) dry up and no longer function. You're left with a slowed and perpetually exhausted mount and the trickle of income from spearmen fishing. Essentially... all gameplay stops. 
The Devs should take a serious look at games that did winter (and other seasonal changes) well, like Don't Starve. In Don't Starve winter brings new challenges and new things to explore. It doesn't just arbitrarily slow the game to a crawl like in Kingdom.

The second are gems-
Once again, a good idea with terrible execution. Gems act as a new limited and valuable resource to obtain higher tier upgrades like shrines that buff your whole kingdom or new mounts for your king with special abilities. The issue is that these gems are only obtainable from non-respawning chests in newly explored islands, so if you lose the gems to the Greed, or get a game over, they're gone for good. The gems being limited in this way basically negates the new respawn mechanic. Sure, if you die, you'll respawn on the first island now, but if you were carrying any gems on you when you bit the dust your save may as well have been deleted like in the original Kingdom.
The gems should be obtainable in some difficult, but renewable, way. Maybe you could get one for every 1000 coins you leave at the banker or something. At the very least you should be able to retrieve lost gems by destroying the Greed portals that they were taken to.

Overall, the game is very very good, but winter and perma-lost gems need to be adressed ASAP.

Edit: (1/2/19)
Enough comments have been made, that I feel the need address a couple of things: 

First, several people have said they've been getting back their lost gems after clearing islands. In my personal experience, and in the experience of some other players, that hasn't been the case. It could be a bug, but the info posted by the dev in the FAQ and Update Road Map imply that a way of recovering gems hasn't been added yet and is planned for sometime in the future, so.... No clue...

Second, in regards to winter, there's a big difference between tedium and difficulty. The issue I have with winter in the current version of Kingdom isn't that it's ""too hard"" it's that its just straight up boring: Don't Starve's winter is difficult but engaging, Kingdom's winter is easy, but tedious.

It's ok, if the games more difficult, it's okay if the last level is not easy and you have to improve your strategies to finally conquer the last island.

"TL/DR: Fun game spoiled by instant kill monster.

I find this a very fun game and concept but alas I must post this as a negative review.
Let me share with you my 4 playthroughs and excerpts from my subsequent discussion post that made me uninstall this game, I invite you to read it yourself if you wish after this, it's currently on top with a ton of chatting going on.

I watched a youtuber play this game and it was the first ""Kingdom"" game I had ever heard of, it looked neat a simple defence game that's quick to learn and enjoy.
I bought it as soon as it was available and started playing it immediately, it was a lot of fun! Then a crownstealer came flying out of nowhere in the middle of the daylight and hit me, skipping my full sack of coins (which every other enemy must empty before defeating you) it knocked the crown off my head and game overed me. This was the second island.

""Odd"", I thought ""maybe I did something wrong?"" as I restarted since I lost all my gems that I knew couldn't be replaced, I started to stay near my base more even during the day because that's what I had been now taught to do in a GAME ABOUT EXPLORATION AND ADVENTURING, I started building my walls out to near the portals and hiding behind them when i didn't need to get more villagers.
I stepped out to build another wall, and after it was built I started to upgrade it as my army progressed towards the new wall, then a crownstealer hit me, also in daylight, knocked my crown off, took it to the portal, game over.

Now getting annoyed, mind you I have survived uncountable numbers of greed sieges, I started over again, for the same reason gem loss.
""THIS time I'll be VERY careful"" I told myself, I waited each time to expand my walls till right after the nightly greed attack, running out only to get villagers then back again, my soul purpose was now to follow my army of archers and squires around so they could defend me. I started to attack my first portal that I had ever gotten to, a crownstealer jumped out of the portal over all my men and you guessed it, knocked my crown off and game overed me. Now my army goes by itself.

At this point I hadn’t looked into the gem issue yet, so restart number 4 and I’ve learned not to explore in this EXPLORATION game and to send my armys out by themselves to not get game overed, if they get destroyed I simply rebuild them, that is easier them facing the instakill.

Max walls, tons of archers and some towers to hide terrified behind, my armies are now three knights and 15+ archers deep on each side of the castle, they rip down everything in their path with waves of arrows that blot out the sun! Except the crownstealer who runs through the invasion force, jumps over the wall, my archers and my hopes and dreams and knocks the crown off my head. Again in a single hit, then run with it past my Towers that are max upgraded, my knights and so many archers it blends in behind them, and none of them can react to it before it game overs me a final time.
Here’s the thing, it’s fast, like 4X the fastest horse you have, it’s fast enough that if it’s in screen with you, you lose, period. It’s so fast my units don’t have time to fire at it at all.
No walls hold it back, no archers or knights can kill it, no strategy to defend against it, there is nothing you can do, it will spawn, it will steal your crown, you WILL LOSE.

Every single discussion that defends this antifun instant game over monster says “Your archers should shoot at it”
SHOULD, HOPEFULLY, PRAY REAL HARD.
If you add a monster into your game that is an instant kill and the rest of the game is based around strategy and tactics, there shouldn’t be a SHOULD for how to defat or defend against it.
I brought this irritante up to the Devs on the community chat and they were nice enough to actually respond, unfortunately their response was 
“Losing your crown is not game over and designed to lose it several times. So, my Greed is doing what I designed it to do, and when.” 
That’s right they have removed the roguelike part of the game and instead made it about seemly forcing you to die a lot.

That was their only response on the chat, there are over 70 comments many others with similar stories to my own and condemning the game killer that is that monster.
Devs I offered you several options to get people back to playing your game, though they probably got lost in the chatting, so here they are again:

1. Remove the Crownstealer.
2. Add in the options menu the ability to decide the number and greed type in a max wave.
Such as putting 10 masked greeds will limit the max wave of those to 10 on one side.
Then people that don't like a certain type of greed can turn it off without forcing others to play 
without it.
3.Slow the crownstealer down or make it take much less arrows to kill, so even stray arrows 
have a chance of killing it.
4.Have archers preference it as a target when it gets within their range.
5.Have a building that promotes archers to Crownstealer hunters, Max three on each side, They 
would get gold bows and 3 would run to the side that the crownstealer spawned on, they would 
act like normal archers till it got within range then focus on just it till it's death. 
The gold bows would let you know that a crownstealer spawned and to run the opposite side 
that they did!
This would also take strategy to be able to keep 3-6 archers open to promote, while balancing 
that with the knight escort and tower needs.

These are a few options that allow the greed to be part of the stratagy of the game rather then just breaking it.

If you are unwilling to read the multiple comment threads on how many people hate that thing then you aren’t making games for other people, you are making a game for yourself to be played your way, and that’s fine, but I will be watching your next games very carefully as I suspect many other will so that when we see you add instant game overs into future games you make, we simply won’t give you the money to keep making the games for only yourself.

The game has some glitches here and there example not being able to pick up a coin after dropping it then leaving and coming back but still not able to and having someone else pick it up (Greed, 2nd Player, Subjects) which can be annoying. 

Island 1 - Compared to Kingdom New Lands the game shows similarites such as boat exit, mounts, hermlins, knights, and the dock located at one end of the map. But I did notice somthing being attacked from both sides. There are greed spawners on both sides which can be irritating for new players and for players who don't have their defenses built. The need for stone and the introduction to gems/diamonds. Stone is a resource needed to build stone walls and the castle. Gems/diamonds are used to get new mounts, stone shrines, and hermlins. Building the boat will give you access to leave the island if you want.

Island 2 - You gain the access to stone and gems on this island. The island (like Kingdom New Lands) gains an extra greed portal. The island which is bigger from the first island gives players more room to build their kingdom. With stone being unlocked the player can destroy the greed portals which will trigger a blood moon. Gems can be found in chests that are located at the remains of the kings and queens castles before you. After leaving the island you can go back to island 1 to destroy the greed portals and/or continue to build with the access of stone. (Yes stone does transfer I also know copper is a thing from building up my castle.)

Island 3 - I had to stopped at 19 minutes from this island do to the fact I had a greed portal blocking me from expanding it also made it so my builders didn't go near it and they couldn't build the second wall and allow me to attack the portal. Do to that I was running low on gold and my left side archers didn't want to go past the boat. The next issue was that some of my archers on the right side (Where the greed portal was located) would attack then get attacked by the greed when they spawned thus lossing their bows and costing more gold.

This game is still a work in progress so I can understand these bugs I did enjoy playing Kingdom New Lands and completing Skull island also completing Kingdom Classic. The varity of new resources make players have to expand and reach new hieghts not found in Classic or New Lands but can be annoying to access cough cough island three. The new units (I only got the spearman do to me not making it to the other islands) making players try new things on defense.

The new features, ideas, artwork, and additions in general in two crowns are really great, and would merit the price if not for the issues that exist. But its disappointing to see some of your favorite devs releasing something that doesnt seem well tested at all.

Issues while not many imo, are serious:
Crown stealer npc was not thought through, there needs to be a defensive strategy created by the devs. Often your game is over for no good reason.
Winter is slow, boring, and theres few ways to earn money and you cant even run the map since the grass is gone.
Serious stuttering (massive framerate drops) is simply unacceptable (i5,gtx970,16gb), literally makes me sick to watch on long runs

I believe the devs will make efforts to fix some of this, and this could easily be a positive review soon enough. But wait on this one, go play new lands some more.

"After spending more than 24 hours on this game, played in several long hour settings, I have to conclude this game currently has several game breaking bugs and therefore is not recommenable. The bugs of concern would be described later on.

The game is a successor of previous games under the same title, ie Kingdom: Classic and Kingdom: New Lands, with added mechanics and upgrades. The game inherited its beautiful pixelart style from precessors and the basic game mechanics are mostly unchanged. However there are several issues with npc ai, the most concerning being workers failing to return to safe area after finishing their tasks. 
The newly added gem mechanics while interesting also limits the amount of exploration for players. First of all, gems occupy more space in the coin pouch which in turn reduces the maximum amount of coin players can carry. Secondly, gems, which can only come from gem chests, are scarce in game and appears to be irreplaceable once lost or spent. This limited nature of the resource again limits the options for unique upgrades in games, which all require gems to unlock. In essence, players are punished when they are carrying gems on them as it both reduces coin carriage and bears the risk of losing an irreplaceable resource and all subsequent upgrades when attacked. 
The game is also currently plagued by bugs, two of them I experienced during my playthrough, both game breaking. First bug is that vagrants/homeless are not respawning in their camps, which effectively rendered my kingdom unable to expand and destined to fail when the eventual blood moon comes. The second bug that I encountered being the forge failing to spawn also breaks the game as without it, I am not able to build the bomb which is needed to clear an island of greed.
I have not played the multiplayer of the game however it is also reported to be bugged. 
In short, the game still provides a fun experience like its precessors, and its music and pixelart style makes the exprience rather enjoyable. However due to currently incomplete game mechanics and bugged gameplay, I can not recommend anyone to buy this game, not until the mechanics are refined and bugs splatted.",False,1545740008

Overall, a solid 9/10.

no,True,1545681674
"So, a lot of reviews lately have said to be careful of the game, but I have to say, I haven't come across any of the bugs that other people are saying happen.

It's another Kingdom game, the same style of graphics and gameplay as the previous two games, with some nice additions and changes. Though there's a lot of ambiguity with information in the game, requiring players to go to the wiki to see what's worth what or what something does.

The multiplayer is a nice idea, though I'll admit now I haven't gotten to try the co-op, as it appears to be friends only cooperative and nobody on my list owns the game to test it.

Overall though the game is a lot of fun, with a lot of replay value.",True,1545679461
"This could be a great game, but the developer has decided they know exactly what they want and are unwilling to listen to their players telling them what would improve this game. The atmosphere is amazing, the idea is insanely good...but it's marred by the foolish idea that a game's difficulty should simply increment up each turn until it kills the player. This is a day one game design class no-no, the mark of someone who thinks failing to balance your game means you can write it off as 'roguelike' and wash your hands. Combine that with the numerous game breaking bugs and you have something that could be gold, if only the developer wasn't their own worst enemy.",False,1545663506
"UPDATE : there are still issues but many bugs have been fixed and content has been added.

Short version: I am looking forward to changing this recommendation to a thumbs up once they fix the bugs, which hopefully they will early 2019 as announced.


Longer review: Okay, this is a tough one.
I like the Kingdom series and this is the best one yet. I love the multiplayer option, like the more developped ending, like that you don't go back to 0 when you lose. It's simple but strategic. I've been having a lot of fun playing in split screen with my husband, discussing what our next move is and what each one of us needs to be doing, and if I played singleplayer again I would play this game and not the previous ones.

BUT as most reviews will highlight, it is still plagued with GAME BREAKING bugs. 

The first time one of the hermits killed themselves by going out at night, my jaw dropped to the floor and I was so amazed I wasn't even upset. (Fun fact: you save the kidnapped hermit if you destroy the Greed on the island and survive.)

The first time our knights jumped into a ship instead of attacking a portal and stayed there, useless for the rest of the game, forcing us to switch islands... I was NOT amused.

It seems that they didn't do any playtesting.

I recommend waiting until the bugs are fixed before buying.",True,1545660689
"The first game is very good. This does not feel like a sequel, but It seems to be all the ideas the devs wanted to add in the first place. I think it adds a lot of content. The Coop is quite fun.

The state the game is in now. I wouldn't recommend it. The only reasons you would play this if you need a co-op game where 2nd player is a girlfriend/nongamer where they can feel like they are playing without doing much. That being said the whole game is a guessing game. Instead of adding content they would rather keep it unknown so you realise its the same damn gameplay 5 times in a row. That being said its very unforgiving if you don't know what to do. The game is mostly running around so your A and D keys are going to get warn fast. Since it doesn't have a tap to run and your always holding it. You spend the entire game killing greed and unlocking statues for upgrades for your troops/buildings. That being said Clearing greed is the most unrewarding bore i've ever experienced. When you actually kill them you would expect some nice little reward or something like EVERY other damn thing but nope. Its nothing. Good Game. You get nothing. Zero! Zilch. Lol. It's a game where you will spend time waiting and waiting and waiting. Its like a clicker but without and reward lol.,False,1545624489

"My GF buy me this game because she want to play with me (we both enjoy to play single player game).
In short version... Not worth money.
Probably game was released before christmas to get easy money income :( Company tur to greedy mode ;( 

Game is good but multiplayer (cooperation via internet) is like a joke, and have havy bugs like:
--- THE WORST BUG! ---> I see a moob in water lvl, so no turret or archer try to kill him, but the night never ends so you don't get ANY GOLD, reload didn't help and we need to START THE WHOLE MAP FROM BEGINNING!
Buildings not build - most of the time is when you build teleporter, and second player dont see it or see in other place.
Can't buy stuff - alot of time's i can't buy tools for farmers because something don't let me do this and my GF didn't have that problem so i need ask she to buy it for us few times...
Pay and get nothing - i pay for explosives barrels (i spend whole money for that) but barrels didn't com out, when i'm ask mu GF she say that she see this building in other palce.

20$ for adding broken multiplayer to the game and not patch that errors for almost 2 weeks is dick move! But company probably try to squeez money from people before christmas.
Sad but you need to think twice before buy the game...

Usless farms - farm get probably less income then a bush with rabbits

Suicide hermits - jump from horse in worst moment or stand in front line just for fun.
Builders IQ <0 - when finish job they stay near that place, if i try build a outpost far away then you are sure you lost them.

Really unfortunate that when I plug in my control, the keyboard and controler don't act as seporate devices, making split screen hard to do with my little brother. Maybe you should allow key mapping and make it so that when someone activates Split Screen, they are required to do a button input.

"This game is very different from others. The foundation; atmosphere, visuals and original concept, has always been the good part of the game. Now when this game first launched, there were so many bugs, dumb ai and unbalanced mechanics/units, that by the time you got to the third island, the game would be unplayable. Builders would just run outside and die, pulling catapults outside and never being able to create new ones even after they have disappeared or moving from one wall to the other outside wall, villagers randomly doing nothing even if there are tools they can use to be productive, and I saw videos where villagers got stuck inside the lake all the way at the bottom of the screen somehow. With that in mind, would I have recommended a new player to trying this game back then? No I wouldn't have.

But now 3 years later, all of the unbalanced units/mechanics have been made fair and most of the bugs are gone now and the game is definitely playable without any bugs. They have made the game better over time with every update adding stuff that people want and that is actually useful. As I am writing this, today they added a difficulty scale and colour on the roman numerals to indicate big attacks and safe days.

With that out of the way, comparing it to the previous games, it is what New Lands should have been and a great expansion off the original kingdom; I wouldn't even consider buying New Lands with this game existing. Statue Boosters from the previous game and new ones only have to be enabled once and then will stay active until you die - they even stay enabled when you go to another island so you don't have to constantly throw money at each statue. They added a very cool new way to finally destroy the big portal in the cliff. There are Spear guys now can get fish out of water even during winter; so if you take too long you still get an income and farmers don't throw their tools away anymore for winter (Which made them a big money grab) now can harvest another crop for only one coin sometime in winter. There are now rotating seasons, so in case of winter you just have to wait instead of rushing to a new island. Every season takes 16 days. Winter is from day 48-64. There now is multiplayer which makes it very fun to goof around which for me was one of the best features they added.

Here are some of the things I found inconvenient back then that took away from the enjoyment of the game that still should be dealt with (Will be updated if changes happen)
- Can't see how many coins the knights have, you just have to try giving them coins and see if they accept them.
- Hermits jumping off when you don't want it to
- Being able to set priorities to builders on what should be done most importantly and least.
- Japanese exclusive unit sucks- fixed and is now too strong.

It's launch was terrible but with their dedicated updates, we now have no bugs even in multiplayer which makes playing this game really fun. This game always had a good platform to build off of, and now that the Devs fixed the issues the community had and consistently listen to us, it's a great game and totally worth the price; one of my favourite games of all time.",True,1545419147

Fantastic artwork, I love the mood that is set by music/sound effects, gameplay is a lot of fun and always interesting to discover new effects and interactions that things have together.  I bought this new entry solely because it now offered co-op and it is a truely fun experience to share with someone else.

My problem is that the game seems more like it should be in open beta rather than full release.  Co-op is riddled with bugs that you have to use interesting work-arounds for.  The partner in my games either couldn't see buildings like the hut to recruit farmers so he was unable to use it completely, or he would put coins into the huts and no bows/hammers/sickles/etc would hit the stand, so it was like an arcade machine stealing quarters with no one around to get my quarter back from. Some mounts have abilities, and if the partner gets a mount it doesn't use it's special ability on command. Sometimes even walls would not show up for the partner and he would have to use educated guessing based on where troops stand at night time for if a wall was present or not. We eventually stopped playing co-op because the bugs were so frequent and impacted how we could play the game so much it was no longer enjoyable. 

In single player I stopped playing after several bugs or poorly designed gameplay elements required restarts of saves many hours in and I simply do not want to repeat a game with the risk of hitting the same bug ending my gameplay again. Trying to destroy a dock portal so sending out knights to go finish it off in that direction and they don't go destroy the dock portal but instead go climb into my boat thereby removing my ability to ever destroy that dock portal unless I maybe go to another island and get them killed first then come back and rebuild the army...no thanks. I like the movement of seasons and different challenges in them but the winter boredom is too much. 16 days (I think it is that long, might be 20) of no income from farms and limiting hunting and small fish income is brutal. Basically it prevents you from starting a new island for the whole time period because you will not have a well funded bank or base set up to withstand attacks for so long so I found myself playing another game and just letting this run in the background. Gems are an interesting addition but the way they were implemented makes this less than enjoyable. You get a limited amount to unlock several key upgrades, but you don't know what anything does unless you check a wiki for it and have someone else tell you what the important things are so you don't waste your limited gems on something that might not be all that useful. And you might as well just give up if you accidentally risk a long night and lose a few gems because you won't be getting them back for a long time to say the least. 

Overall, the game was fun for 13 hours but too many game ending bugs and incredible let downs regarding save progress make me want to just go back to other entries in the series. Co-op would be a reason to buy this alone if there were not so many bugs preventing it from being enjoyable.",False,1545211811
"Deserves a negative review for the very poorly-considered winter mechanic.  Not that it is too hard, but that the player has nothing to do for approximately an hour - EXCEPT lose the game if they become too curious looking for a way out of this temporary dead end.

"Nothing extremely deep here. Just a solid thing to relax and play. I reccomend getting it in a sale or something, but I don't necessarily regret paying full price for the amount of hours I predict playing this for.

"Sunk dozens of hours into Kingdoms New Lands and can tell I will do the same for the second. 
The continuous timeline mechanic is nice, and the gems are a bit unwieldy to manage but a decent new mechanism to keep things interesting.

"At release the game is very buggy.  This makes it very annoying and impossible for some lands.  

Some of these bugs are:
 -vagrants stop spawning
 -night/day sky doesn't show
 -the bread in the bakery dissappears
 -fisherman suicide
 -knights/squires board the boat instead of attacking a portal
 -farmers will stay at the castle instead of going to a farm
 -rabbits spawn far away from the outer wall so only a few are kiled by the archers

  They have added some nice additions, but some of them increase frustration.  Gems are required to get hermets, mounts, and statues. but these gems are limited and if lost can't be replaced.  Einter now ends, but it leaves 16 days of very little income, increasing the grind of the game.  You can keep mounts at a farmhouse, but the cost of changing to some of the mounts are very high, even after beng unlocked once in a game.

Overall its a disappointment over the previous two games.",False,1545186791

I've been playing since Classic. This new game is filled with bugs. Complete rushed into production. Wait until the patch to buy this.,False,1545145033
Great game without optimisation for mac. I've played a lot previous parts and decided to buy new one but immedeately after launch game loads my CPU for 99% and fan starts spinning like crazy. Right now I don't recommend this game due problems with CPU overload.,False,1545140161
"There is, at this point, no reason to play this over the original.

1. Neither of the new troops work correctly

2. Features that worked in the old game are once again broken.  Farms spawn with walls/rocks surrounding them, only allowing you to make one field, while a farm with no rocks or walls around it can have like 8 so it's super rng based.  Troop ai is retarded.

3. Difficulty is exactly the same, except now you get over powered mounts.  Once you get the salamander mount they can solo anything they throw at you.  So you're basically just... running back and forth collecting troops as they spawn from huts.

4. WINTER - Imagine playing a game 1/3 of the game you spend unable to do anything.  So it's 20-40 minutes of you sitting in camp as your troops easily kill everything they comes close until the grass starts to grow back.

5. Building is clunky and was designed to screw you over constantly.  Remember the huts I mentioned?  IF you cut down trees to progress your front line, the huts will vanish.  Lets say you start the game and don't know this.  You will run out of troops to hire and be unable to progress and slowly die.

6. Almost all the new features/old features don't work correctly.  Units will sit on the dangerous side of the wall as a wave of greed run them down because for some reason the greed are spawning in day light?

7. The boss caves are the exact same thing over and over, except every time you run one they add one more enemy spawner.  At the end of the boss cave you plant a bomb and have to run out.  This is another thing that screws you over, as if you don't have the right mount it's impossible to leave on time so you will die!  Did I mention death yet?

8. If you die, you respawn at the very first island at the start of spring.  You will notice mostly everything you built is now broken.  And all your buffs/upgrades are gone.  So now you have to spend a good 10-30 minutes running back and forth, rebuilding nessessary money making things!  Also all of your farmers lose their jobs!   So will mostly every single archer!  So you will have like 100 jobless nerds sitting in camp waiting for you to spend gold to buy them jobs again!  ALSO THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENS WHEN YOU TRY TO GO BACK TO OLD AREAS -Minus the loss of buffs-

All and all this game is a cluster fuck of good ideas put together poorly.  If you learn all the ways the game screws you over every playthrough is just FIND A FARM!  BUILD TOWARDS THE FARM SPOT!  SET UP THE FARM!  HIRE FARMERS TO MAKE MONEY!  DO NOTHING BUT RUN BACK AND FORTH HOPING THAT YOUR ARCHERS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HUNTED DEER OR RABBITS!  GET MONEY!  RECRUIT PEASANTS!  MAKE PEASANTS INTO ARCHERS!  MAKE LIKE 100 ARCHERS!  KEEP BUILDING TOWARDS THE EDGES OF THE MAPS!  EASILY DESTROY EVERYTHING!  WINTER HAPPENS DO NOTHING FOR 20-40 MINUTES!  FINALLY COVER THE ENTIRE MAP!  DESTROY THE FINAL CAVE WITH A BOMB!  Repeat x 5

One last thing... Guard towers exist in the game.  The spots you can build them spawn randomly.  So you will almost never use them because once you build a guard tower, archers automatically go inside it.  They will never leave it unless something kills them.  Something being flying pasta monsters that grab them and fly away with them, unless you upgrade your towers a bunch, which just means more troops go into them and never leave.  Meaning your front line now has less archers.",False,1545123710
"Potentially a great expansion to the base game, but wow is it buggy and unpolished at the moment. Feels like a beta rather than a full release.

-AI is still bad, possibly even worse than before. Builders will often stand around out in the open after a job and get robbed.
-Freshly recruited citizens will verrryyyy slowly walk back to your kingdom from their camps in the forest. Which sucks when they're further out and the journey takes half a day, or more, for them to arrive. Assuming they don't get robbed by the Greed before making it there.
-The new gem mechanic makes it very difficult to actually hold any coins due to the sheer volume of space the gems take up. Gem scarcity punishes exploring new mechanics. Pick one mount and learn to love it, because that's the only one you're getting.
-Still can't kick archers out of old useless towers that are 300 feet behind the front lines.
-Farm are *extreamly* buggy. Which is bad, because they're your main source of income once you've built up your base.
-The ninja from the Shogun Biome are both pointless and overpriced. A waste of both men and gold. They'll do their thing, and then permanently vanish. Except a firebarrel does what they do only much better and for cheaper. They can't even serve as a source of gold like the pikemen can with their fishing.

"NEW COMMENTARY AFTER ANOTHER 82 HOURS (with patch 1.1.7):
Well, I'm sorry to say, but this game is still very bugged. Don't get me wrong, it's fun to play, hence the 82 more hours played, however the bugs are exhausting. Some patches make game better, some introduce new bugs and some reintroduce bugs that were absent for a year.

Here are some of the bugs:
* archers decide to go outside walls in the middle of night thus getting stupidly killed
* builder decide to build that building outside of walls also in the middle of the night - the same building they ran away before night to be safe inside the walls
* Miriam's ""freezing whip"" from dead lands just stops working and game has to be restarted
* my online parner gets stuck at never ending night and game also has to be restarted to resolve
* online parner can't buy anything (wearing a crown), restart also resolves this issue
* sometimes money can't be grabbed, I have to wait for archer to grab it and give it to me
* place where you buy balista or farmes suddenly dissapears even if you don't do anything to the walls or trees
* Doggo disappearing after restart
* lot of graphical glitches (flasks floating in space, money under the pouch, greeds that stopped animating, greeds that are moon walking towards me)

Sometimes we have to restart more then ten times per island to fight those recuring issues. So COME ON, FIX THE GAME and then work on new features nobody asked for, like universal saving (which takes ages sometimes to complete even on my 420MBps internet) and multi-platform play and so on.


OLD COMMENTARY:
TL;DR: Great game, freaking lots of frustrating and almost game-breaking bugs even after 1.0.1 patch. Don't buy until fixed.

Long version:

I'd love to recommend this game. I love the original game, I love this game too, but there are horrible bugs and some of them are game-breaking. I wouldn't buy this game now, I'd wait until devs fix these issues.
* Hermits go outside of the walls and are taken by hordes and you can't do anything about it.
* AI is buggy - sometimes builders just keep standing at their last location and are taken.
* Achievement system is very broken (at least in multiplayer).
* Multiplayer game is lot of fun, but it's buggy as hell. Sometimes I see different level of walls and towers than my partner, sometimes I or my partner just disappear, sometimes my partner is unable to buy bows and hammers, sometimes the game lags even though we are on the same network, sometimes I see completely different parts of land...
* Worse of all, after few hours of game, we were run over by hordes on fourth island, we were sent back to the first island and when I closed and saved the game after few days on first island, I was unable to load game again. I had to reinstall the game and we basically lost all of our progress. I was VERY FRUSTRATING to say at least.


--------- UPDATE: After update to 1.0.1, the game runs slightly better (it's a little less frustrating) UNTIL you hit final island, where new problems start to arise:
• Archers randomly freeze and aren't hunting.
• After the blood moon, the night never ends (it lasted for more than 8 days until I didn't have more patience to wait) until you restart game.
• Knights go outside of the walls when night falls and their archers die instantly.
• Sometimes you can buy firebombs, but none appear.
• Knights and greed don't have animations, they just slide across map completely frozen.
• At some random times farms don't generate money until you restart game.
• Bakery does nothing. We have 10 breads and nobody is coming. Sometimes bread appears on the ground or disappears.
• With first snow banker stopped coming out, so even thought we have a lot of money in a bank, there's nobody who can give it to us.
• Catapult fires at wrong direction (into the people, not into incoming greed wave)
• I see blood moon and my partner has bright day with greeds attacking.
• Sometimes builders stop after chopping the tree in the middle of the forest and wait for greeds to be taken.
• Sometimes day starts with sun setting and another night starting in few seconds.

--- Don't get me wrong. I love this game, I have about 40 hours played in multiplayer. It is just REALLY FRUSTRATING to the levels you start to question you life choices that lead you to this bloody buggy game.",False,1545079087
"I was hoping for actual progression through the islands, not a blatant ""you've made it to the final island, you're now screwed"" situation. No way to recruit new workers as the camps are behind portals, I was at least able accumulate enough money from hunting with the 6 archers I started with to almost rebuild the ship, in order to go back and find the single hermit (for the bakery upgrade) to make this island playable. Using the dragon mount and strong walls to defend against every wave. Yet for some reason on day 10 I'm swarmed by an impossible to defend against horde, at least impossible with 3 archers on each side. 

Thanks for wasting my time. 

Update:
Tried playing it again, and it is riddled with bugs. Lazy Devs made a cash grab. The success of the first two games was clearly a fluke.

Dead Lands Update:
Cool new mounts, cool swapping monarchs, game is still too difficult for singleplayer. Game was clearly designed to only be easily beatable with 2 players. Why doesn't the game scale it's difficulty for solo. Yes it's winnable but how much time do I need to put into this crap to keep doing the same thing over and over. 

I really want to enjoy this game more, but it's really stupid having all statues unlocked,  structures maxed out with 20+ archers on each side, catapult, lizard fire & ice wall, yet still get overwhelmed by a wave after destroying my first portal on the 5th island. Survived the wave barely, but with 50+ vagrants and no source of income GOOD LUCK rebuilding your base. Such a time waste.

I'm out, never going to try this crappy game again.",False,1545063442

Gameplay is tedious and repetitive.

Issues:

Restarts required due to AI bugging out.

Arbitrary, unpredictable bomb spawning.

Other obvious things - when hermits are standing in front of your Town Centre, you can't actually upgrade it because - UI issues. I actually have to pick one hermit up to clear his UI out of the way, upgrade, run to an outer wall, wait for nightfall, wait for after wave, then run out before dawn to get the damn thing off my back. What should be a 2 second upgrade becomes half my day and morning wasted to UI.

Hermits jumping off while running toward the base - when did this become a thing? Aren't they interested in safety?

Farms only building on one side of the farmhouse - why is this a thing now? Has that other long stretch of grass been salted or something?

These things worked fine in the earlier games and have now become illogical and broken.",True,1545047807

"First of all, I loved the first two Kingdom games. They were fun in a relaxing sort of way but I can't give this one a positive review for one reason. There are seasons in this game and when winter rolls around all of your production stops. ZERO gold generation. You are essentially on a soft pause for 30 minutes when winter hits. And if you are playing single player you cannot alt-tab or browse the internet because the game then actually pauses.

AI is pretty bad too but that's true for all of the Kingdom games. Critical NPCs will move past your gates and let the Greed monsters just carry them away.

"My Fiancée and I played this Co-op, and it was our first foray into the Kingdom series. It will be our last. 

There is no game here. You spawn in on a presumably randomly generated island, and a ghost takes you to where you build your kingdom. There is no choice or decision making about setting up your kingdom, no balance between defensability and resources to strike. It's all decided for you. Once you set your first kingdom up, you expand outwards in two directions, left and right. However, You don't get to choose where to build buildings - they all appear on pre-set spots, and you just pay for them. You can't control your units, either.  Not even indirect control, like asking them to rally. Not that there are many units - archers shoot enemies, pikemen hit them through walls. There are no (as far as we fiound) Swordsmen or cavalry, and no strategy in combat. Just make sure you have enough troops and hope for the best. 

In effect, all you do is walk between 'moneymakers' (merchants, Hunters, farmers) to collect money and whatever the next building is, purchase it, and repeat. No decision making, no real 'resource management' (oh, you don't have of the one currency in the game? Just wait 5 minutes!) I've played mobile games with more actual gameplay than this. 

There *is* another currency, gems, but they hardly count as part of the gameplay loop since you can't actually affect getting them in anyway. They appear out of chests, seemingly randomly. It is these you use to purchase upgrades, but again, there is no gameplay here. Unless you know what you are buying and can make some sort of strategic decision about the upgrades, it's not gameplay - it's guessing. Some might be motivated to learn what all the upgrades do and how to get them from the wiki, but all that information should be in the game natively. And besides, even if you did, there still isn't much to do left over. Some upgrades, like what you get from the Hermit, are also random.

"Things to be changed:

As there are more hermits, whether it is bug or not, the bug that hermits go outside the kingdom wall should be fixed. Hermits in Kingdom Two Crowns, unlike the previous game, now only appear once through out the whole campaign. Therefore, once I lose any of them, I cannot get them anywhere back. The only way is to restart the campaign.

I understand the game is made for multi-players. But there are many people like me who do not like to play games with others. All the buildings now require much more coins, but the size of the coin pouch is the same as the previous game. With gems, I cannot store enough coins in the pouch for some of the buildings. If I was playing with another player, the coin pouch would be enough. But I really think for single-players, the coin pouch size should become bigger for convinience.

"Update to my review: I decided to give this game one more chance after a recent patch. I tried to connect to my friends game. Loading failed to finish and the loading bar froze. And now I can't even enter a game. I mean AT ALL. Because to enter a game you need to load your last save which I can't. Even reinstalation is not solving this. I literally can't play a game anymore. Probably for the best.

Fix to this problem: you need to delete your save files that is here: Username/appdata/locallow/noio/kingdomtwocrowns/release
Then you will be able to start a new campaign. But the fact that this glitch is existent is saying a lot by itself.

Cannot recommend this game at it's current state. 
Lots of bugs especially in coop mode both visual and gameplay braking. 
Few new stuff that is not very useful. Basically the same game that luring people with promise of campaign and coop experience both of which are made poorly and not worth the money that is asked for this.

"This is an edit to a 3 year old review, which was negative. The reasons are described below. I just played the Norse Lands Demo and by thors hammer, it was great. It is immediately visible that the pixel art is even better than before, very clear and subtly masterful. The soundscape is fantastic - i'm not sure if it was like that before, but the ambience is great. I love that the music both feels fitting, but also ventures a bit into another direction. I spent a few scenes in the fog or at sunset that really moved me, where i felt exactly what i felt when i fell in love with Kingdom. Because of that, i tentatively changed the review to positive. The issues below were rage inducing when trying to progress, but the game does so much right in the other departments and improved upon it, that negative does not feel justified. After all, i recommended it very often in real life.
I have a disclaimer though, that i found very disappointing. I found myself riding with a hermit through the woods, with 2 coins in the afternoon. Greed appeared on the side, surprisingly - which prompted the hermit to get off my horse. What an idiot, i half expected this. I quickly spent a coin getting him back up, being careful not to accidentally build something - and wouldn't you know it, he got down from the horse after 5 steps again. So, hermits suicidal as ever. I don't understand why i can't just hit up or hold up to set one down, but have to wait ages until one goes down from the horse - unless he finds himself in the worst possible situation to get down (a chance he doesn't want to miss!).
Because of this, the ""positive"" is tentatively. If i feel like rage quitting again because the hermits go crazy, my rational thought will be gone, probably :P


Original Review:
I'm happy that there is a new episode in this series. I don't even mind that a buy basically the same game a third time, not at all.
I have [strike]two[/strike] three big issues with the game. 

First of all, the gems are not fitting the style of the game, very clunky mechanic. The gems are finite in the campaign. You have no way of figuring out how many there are, and how many you can potentially spend. The things you spend it on usually only show their merit upon buying. In my first run, i bought everything and had to restart after many hours, because some crucial upgrades were simply not unlockable anymore. This is a hurtful mechanic for the game, as it seemed to value exploration and trial&error before. This way, trial and error becomes prohibitive and you basically have to rely on a wiki or restart completely once you saw everything, which robs you from curiosity.

(update: the hermit behaviour is probably fixed as of 19.12.2018. I will update this if i can verify they behave properly now)
Secondly, the brain dead hermits. I had to restart my second and third campaign because a hermit left the safe area of my kingdom, wandered into the woods and got captured. [strike]You have no way of ever getting them back.[/strike] Again, worst case is you cannot (in any sane way) finish the campaign and have to restart. Which i did. I then took great care of my hermits...until one evening, the smith that was standing at the wall for 3 days, decided out of the blue to wander directly into the hoard of greed that were slamming against the wall he was behind, leading to his capture. What the actual fuck. They seem incredibly intent on getting captured. Once i found the smith standing a huge distance from the outermost wall, despite having tons of space on the inside. If i had not randomly walked by, he would have been gone.

Lastly, the seasons. While it can work nicely and create some tension, it can also be incredibly boring and take out all fun. Ever had to wait 20 ingame days, doing nothing, until winter is over? I think i ran into another bug when i was in the middle of summer and suddenly, on destroying my first portal, it was immediate winter. My kingdom is strong, but i have no savings as it was not even autumn yet. So now i have to wait 20 days doing nothing in the hopes that this apparent bug will not prevent spring.

There are also a lot of smaller things. Once you have a boat, you cannot attack a portal in that direction anymore, because your knights will rather go into the boat. Other thing, if you upgrade your squires to knight you basically signed their death warrant, because they like to jump outside of the walls and get themself killed. Next thing, thinking about going back to an old island? Better be fast with buildup, because your old small settlement (without any walls now) will meet just as big waves as your recent island.

I just cannot recommend it like it is. While it has a great atmosphere and i love the coop aspect, i cannot deal with the fact that i'll have to restart over and over again because of bugs. And it's not like ""hey, the game is new, give some time to patch things"" - these behaviours existed also for the same game released 3 years prior. I do not expect them to get fixed, this just looks sloppy.",True,1544902322
"I cant put my finger on why yet, but I'm enjoying Two Crowns less than the previous two games.

20/12/2018 - I've changed this review to recommended. I initially said that I couldnt work out why I wasnt enjoying this game as much as New Lands. 

That was because the early game of Two Crowns isnt very different to the previous two games. In fact some of the features I liked from previous games had been changed. For example; I missed having to push the boat to the dock. 

However, the more I play it, the more new features I see, and the more I enjoy it. I'm still not enjoying it as much as New Lands, but I expect it to continue getting more fun as I discover the new features.

I don't know if singleplayer works good but I would recommend you to wait until multiplayer is fixed. Because the first experience is really precious, you'd rather have a problemless one. We still really enjoy the game, but please fix stuff. For example you spend 20 gold for bows, then you realise your money is gone but there is no bows around.",True,1544897786
"Before I begin, Steam informs me that I played the original Kingdoms over 98 hours.  That means I liked the game a lot.  
I was pleasantly surprised to find a new version.  Not surprising, it's a lot like the original game although it has new lands, graphics, gems, mounts, etc.  You can also play coop (have not tried).
I'm enjoying the new version so far.  I've ran into a few bugs (archers walking in the air, just had to force quit the game as it wasn't taking me to the main screen).  I'm sure the developers will get these ironed out soon enough.  
A do have a few complaints:  
1.  I don't like the gems.  They take up room in your gold bag and aren't always useful on a given level.  Not too mention, the very first level shows you a few items that require gems - none are available on that map.  Frustrating as I spent time looking for them.  I don't see a major purpose to them except as an additional inventory item.
2.  The first few levels were easy.  I get to level 3 and its a winter map.  No deer or rabits.  No farms.  This is a difficult map and I think it's a quick jump in complexity if someone hasn't played before.  (I've played a lot and still lost the first time through - need to learn the trick to beat the level).

To summarize - if you liked the original games, you will probably like this one.  Just don't expect a totally new games - its MOTS.  In this case, I'm happy with MOTS and will likely spend a lot of time playing it.",True,1544896602

"I have been awaiting this game for a while, so suffice to say I had high expectations...

And Kingdom Two Crowns delivered on all of those expectations and more. Granted I have not fully completed the game yet, but from what I have played I am extremely excited. The updates to the base system are great. The new teir of buildings is unique and a great addition. The gem system adds another level of complexity that I quite appreciate. The new mounts are fricken amazing. The new specialists that upgrade your kingdom are great and quite inventive adding many new upgrade trees to buildings. The new Pikemen are super exciting and quite useful. The new gra[hics are beautiful as always. The amount of polish and little additions makes the world feel so much more alive. The new customization on the character models was a welcome surprise. 

All this stuff is great, but there is one thing I would like to mention above all else.The BIOMES. I often think of how to improve game as I play them. And the one thing I always wished they would add when playing Kingdom New Lands was different Kingdoms to lead. And what do you know? They did just that. The classic English Kingdom is fun as always, but the Japanese Kingdom! I couldn't even contain my excitement. All new enviroments, all new character models for both your character and the NPCs, and more Kingdoms to come in future updates!

"TLDR: Excellent game with high replay value- but can be grind-y and formulaic. Worth getting for sure, but when on sale. 

I initially gave this game a negative review because it cost ~£16 and each playthrough provides 3-6 hours of content. Moreover, the kind of gameplay is the exact same as previous Kingdom games. It is very formulaic, and can be grind-y and tedious. Kingdom: Two Crowns has a decent amount of content, but could definitely do with more. 

However, I still really enjoyed this game, and think it's worth getting. It's just fun. The replay value is also very high- each playthrough is maybe ~5 hours, but I've done 4 because you can just wait a few months and start playing it again. Gameplay is engaging, satisfying, and addictive. You are sort of doing the exact thing every playthrough, but what you're doing is fun. It's great to play with a podcast/playlist in the background, because whilst it isn't super focus-intensive it's still fun to play.

"edit: upon reading the comments (1) im going to put a TLDR at the end :3 

love it love it love ittt!!! i can't wait to play coop with my boyfriend!!! the sprites are bautifull! and since i also own the switch version i can really tell a GREAT UPGRADE in everything!!! 

side note on the gems thaught.
at first i saw the diamonds shapes for the mounts and went ""GOD F!CKING DEAMNIT HERE WE GO WITH STUPID GEMS AND STUFF JFDHjlèkfsnk"" but then arrived the steel chests, which looks very pretty btw and BUH BAM here you go 2-3 gems for you! i was like ""OOOOOOOOHH YEEAAAAHHHH"" 

but it became a problem around the 3rd island........you see gems are used for things like mounts,hermits and so on. but WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF COINS AND HAVE ONLY GEMS it just feels like trying to buy a 5$ item but can't because you only have 100$ bills lol. 

so yeah patience is a vertue regarding that AND THE ANIMATION i can no longer *yeet* a coin whille runing. that's no longer a thing, i have to stop for the animation to happen and then resume my running.
(can still do that in the switch version thaught :P ) 

also about the gems BEWARE OF ACCIDENTALY YEET ONE WHILLE RUNNING AND RECRUITING. keeping an eye on your coin/gems in your poket is super important because as soon as you dont have coins you just throw a gem instead.

edit: i dscovered the feudal japan biome and IM SHOOK it's so pretty! also had to restart 2 or 3 times because i realised my empress was in fact an empror because of the tiny pixel that consisted his goatee......so yeah tiny details everywhere there too.


TLDR: love the game it's really great the first 5 mins but quikly become a series of facepalms after that. the beauty (hi im french and i can't spell) of the game is there just to hide the imperfections that hits you in the face one after the other.  -this will be a long tldr because it's fresh in my head- might modify the review if it gets too long-",True,1544816816

"[h1]This review assumes that you are familiar with Kingdom: New Lands and are willing to be spoiled on new gameplay and mechanics.[/h1]

[quote=summary]Kingdom Two Crowns is essentially New Lands but with 5-6 DLC packaged in. The asking price is fair. However, the new content added into the formula begins to highlight the issues with its automation and ambiguity, it ends up hurting the game as much as beefing it up.[/quote]

Let us start with the goodies. It is more Kingdom! More of the same! Expanded!

… I… uh… that’s it? There’s more stuff to do, more to keep track of, new improvements and units, great music, and a bigger goal than just getting off the godforsaken island. Having a second player will ease up on the legwork and is recommended mode of play, although it is perfectly manageable alone. Everything’s better with a buddy, you can even do splitscreen when playing solo to save time!

Learning new mechanics are still trial-and-error experiences. How do get a forge to spawn? How to attack portals on the side of the boat if the boat is deployed? What the flip does Griffin do? How do you make the bomb go backwards? Don’t answer them, they are for you to figure out, I already did my homework. Some experiments can cost you a run.

Generally, your enjoyment and frustrations from Kingdom Classic and New Lands will carry over to this game. 

[i]Capisci? Alright, let’s get to the bads.[/i]

First up, the most glaring one, the game has got network technical issues, in regards with online co-op. Frequent desync, at times the second screen will display different or missing objects, or cause the partner to be unable to invest with coins, and other gameplay mishaps. Lack of features in communication was circumvented with Discord, but it was worth a mention. As for single player, I have personally yet to experience any major defects with my hours logged.

Builders, the greed’s coming. Oh my god they have headphones on. They can’t hear us. Oh my god. Builders are AR-SE to work with. Now they don’t go back after chopping trees until it is dark and it is often too late because they are TERRIBLE runners. Not to mention that they are workaholics they will charge into invaders to mount that one ballista tower. Sometimes, one mishap will cost you ALL your builders. Meanwhile, same can be said about Hermits, they are manageable while horseback but sometimes they wander too close to wall at night and get kidnapped. What.

The campaign mode is a double-edge. While it is nice that the kingdoms will now (barely) last, the introduction of gems, decay and seasons… can be detrimental. Gems are used for unlocking progression, but bloody heck they take up a lot of space in the pouch, [b]AND DOESN'T RESPAWN* AFTER YOU LOSE THEM, PERMANENTLY DEPRIVE UPGRADE OPTIONS FOR THAT PLAYTHROUGH[/b]. Decay happens when you revisit an island after a good while: your old stuff is still there except a buttload of them is missing and the trees don’t respawn and THE ENEMY WAVES’ INTENSITY CARRIES OVER FROM ANOTHER ISLAND. You may return to an island and encounter nightmarish first days if you have no money in the bank, especially during the wrong season.

Four seasons. Cool. What’s that? Winter is now mandatory? Wonderful! Now every quarter of the game involves putting the game on windowed mode and me watching Youtube. Great. Winter is coming, some of you are alright, don’t go to another island. At least there’s this new recruit Spearmen who will generate some money and gives me something to d—OH WAIT THAT UNIT ISN’T AVAILABLE FOR THE SHOGUN BIOME.

A lot of these seem nitpicky. But, really, they encompass a large portion of the game. Immersion breaking bugs, braindead builders, progression, pacing… urgh. It adds up. I do seriously not recommend this until they iron out some of the bores. If you haven’t already, go play New Lands instead.

*It is possible that the gem chests respawn via unintuitive means, [spoiler]such as keeping the forest ruins intact and revisiting the island after 4 seasons or losing the crown. dunno didn’t test lol. The entire game revolves around deforestation and now this happens. Ngl I find having forests within borders now be a little bit more viable since deers continue to spawn.[/spoiler]",False,1544810330
"Short and sweet: A fantastic little game that I highly recommend. The calming music, delightful pixel graphics, and relatively simple gameplay loop of building up your kingdom during the day and defending at night make this game a pleasure to play. Read a guide before playing if you don't enjoy figuring things out through trial/error, otherwise, rest easy in knowing that everything can be recovered later on.

No tutorial: The game can be somewhat polarizing because absolutely nothing is explained. This means that if you intend to play the game without a guide you may feel heavily pressured to restart fairly frequently so you can correct your mistakes. I personally just read a guide and some pages on the Kingdom wiki to figure out basic mechanics and everything has been excellent thus far. You can customize characters, banners, recover items seemingly lost forever, etc. but won't know any of this without reading the guides.

It's a mix of Roguelike and Sandbox gameplay: Nearly everything in the game can be recovered. Soldiers, hermits, etc. Future patches have promised to change nearly everything to everything. Death is not the end, but is in fact a mechanic to take the pressure off and allow you to rebuild so you can make another attempt. Because of this, I think the game strikes a nearly perfect balance between roguelike and sandbox. You could choose to quit upon death and have a great roguelike. You can also choose to play casually and then, when you die, simply build up and start again with lowered difficulty as per the games mechanics. I really enjoy that it caters to such a wide range of playstyles.

Stability/Bugs?: I play local co-op with my spouse and we've encountered no bugs of any kind. Some of the AI I've heard has been bothersome from others, such as the AI of the hermits, I personally haven't seen. They do jump off your horse if you try and leave your walls at night. This can get them stolen by the enemies. But just plan ahead and kill the enemies before having them jump off and they'll go rest securely at your town center until you need them. The developers are active in the forums and have stated they are already prioritizing a fix to make the AI better, so I imagine that issue will fade away in short time as well.",True,1544805784

Oh boi. Where do I begin.

Cons:
[list]
[*]All the same bugs that vere present in the first game
[list]
    [*]all fixed that I remember
[/list]

[*]Map generation algorithm was not looked at it seems, as game now has more stuff but there now even less of a chance of a good map being generated.
[list]
    [*] Much better now, due to how game is layed out - still expect some quirks here and there, but issues I was having are gone
[/list]
[*]Still no real control over which units you are recruiting and in which order. Especially relevant mid-late game when goddamn pikemen keep breaking their spears and you need to rehire them but all of a sudden they are all archers now cause bows were closer.
[list]
  [*] Still there, only real way to control this is to not buy tools until you need them, oh well.
[/list]
  
[*]Placement of new buildings is out of wack, want to get a forge? Be ready to expand right up to the end of the map cause of random wall placement it can't spawn any closer
[list]
    [*] Appears completely addressed. Haven't had this issue in a while.
[/list]

[*]Music is a toss-up, it's either beautiful or terrible - What's up with midi piano tunes? wtf? who thought those were a good idea?
[list]
    [*] Yup, midi piano. I love the soundtracks, but there are several songs that are just bad. Not there   for Shogun though it seems. 
[/list]

[*]Gems are a pain to manage, and this could've been fixed by just giving player another pouch.
    [list]
[*] No second pouch but a gem banker - can live with that.
[/list]
[*]A lot of questionable design choices. Feature creep made this game somewhat complex, but amount of control player has doesn't match that at all, 3 buttons are def not enough anymore.
    [list]
    [*] This has been greatly improved. Bakeries now autorecruit, new buildings, QoL etc. etc. The game feels much more cohesive now than it was at launch. 
[/list]
[/list]

Pros:
[list]
[*]More of the same
[*]Splitscreen I guess
[*]A bit more in depth progression which frankly should have been in the first game

Most of the bugs have been fixed and even though there´re still some syncing issues in 2 player mode every once in a while the game became enjoyable :)

****************************************************************************

I've been waiting for this game a long time and it would take A LOT to make me write a negative review. I have one basic issue - the multiplayer is UNPLAYABLE. 

Time and season change doesn´t sync for both players. One player can all of a sudden lose control over functions like buying units and upgrading buildings. So instead of dividing responsibilities you´re like: ""Is it night on your screen, cause I have no idea!"" - ""Yeah! Can you come over and buy some archers? Cause I can´t!""

Not sure if it´s a multiplayer issue or a general complaint -  the in game units act like complete morons - my knights once frose in place in a middle of the attack on the final portal. 

Fix it and then we´ll talk.",True,1544745282
"I'm not sure what to say about this game. I've never wanted to leave a positive review after a frustrating experience. 

I'm not sure what Kingdoms: Two Crowns is intended to be. 

I've read that Kingdoms: Two Crowns is supposed to be a strategy game. At no point did I engage in strategy.

I've read the game is supposed to be hard. It is pretty easy.

I've read that this game has been expanded. It seems pretty bare bones.

I've read that people have put in hundreds of hours to some of the previous Kingdom titles. I ran out of anything interesting to do after ten. I played for maybe thirteen. 

Despite all that, I'm recommending this game to you anyway, though I'd suggest waiting for a patch or two.

Had an issue where upgrading one building stopped other buildings from working.

Also, not a bug but winter is now unavoidable. Seasons change, and winter comes and goes. *Most* economy halts in the winter, so you mostly just have to wait it out. Sure, you could efficiently bank and do a bunch of things every five days or so but it's honestly more enjoyable to just alt-tab for an hour or so.

"First off, I am biased because I love the series, but I will try to be fair with this review.

TL;DR the game has some issues and bugs at the moment, but for anyone who enjoys micro-strategy, puzzle solving, base management, tower defense or exploration/discovery, this game should be a fun romp. It caters to both those who have played the previous games, and those who have not. It is fun to play in multiplayer, although the bugs make it a little frustrating at times. That being said, I fully expect that the devs will fix those issues, as they are reliable when it comes to updates. I can absolutely recommend buying the game now, despite the bugs, as it is still fully playable.

Pros:

- Micro-strategy is tight*; everything has a purpose and you can muddle through the easier islands without much strategy but the later islands will kick your arse if you haven't figured it out

- New Content; for those of us who have already played kingdom, kingdom classic, and kingdom new lands, Two Crowns has new content, and a new game play strategy that changes the game sufficiently to make it new and exciting again

- Exploration; there is a lot to explore and discover. I gaurantee that you will not discover everything on your first playthrough

- Tutorial; for those of us who have NOT played any of the previous games, two crowns has improved the tutorial process lightyears from what it used to be while still retaining the air of discovery that drew me to the game in the first place. Don't expect everything to be laid out on a silver platter for you, there is an element of puzzle-solving to the game.

Cons:

- The multiplayer has more than a few bugs. I wouldn't say it is unplayable, because it is playable, but the bugs are very upsetting and they do spoil the experience of the game at times, especially when it was something I was so excited for.

- *Overpowered mounts; playing multiplayer, the combination of the griffon and the dragon mount has been a little OP. I am not sure if this was intended but with a dragon and a griffon you can just blast through portal after portal at the moment. It takes a little away from the tight micro-strategy aspect of the game.",True,1544663782
"This game definitely lived up to the expectations, I waited a long time for this game to come out, and the wait certainly paid off. I played the original game years back and immidiately fell in love with the beauty and simplicity of it, the gameplay was polished and well thought out and the soundtrack was amaizing.

But I always wished kingdom would become multiplayer and thought to myself that it probably never would be.

The game lives up to the expectations with the co-op gameplay combined with some of the new lands features added in. The gameplay, yet sometimes a bit clunky for people connecting to the server, was just as good as the original but better as it added more features including a new tech system, new mounts, and new enemies. Not to mention the amaizing ending.

Overall I fully reccomend this game if they were a fan of the original, but I would not buy this game before buying the original; play the original first to get used to the basics.

The game also explains absolutely nothing and has zero information about anything. What does that unit do? Who knows. What does this building do? Who knows. What does upgrading my archer tower do? Who knows. Curious what the differences between the mounts are? Guess.

Everything missing or unexplained feels like missed opportunities and the game feels incomplete without them. Sure, long-time fans of Kingdom get it. Nobody else does. I wouldn't buy this game.

"A little background; I've played the first two installments in the 'Kingdom' Series. So, upon purchasing the third, I wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't think that Raw Fury could somehow one up themselves again, but with Kingdom Two Crowns they're scrapping dangerously close to peak craftsmenship. I've seen a lot of people complain that it is basically the same game as New Lands and can't help but wonder if we're playing the same semi-warcraft roguelike tower defense game. On the surface they do look 'nearly' identical but how one plays drastically adjusts when you realize what Raw Fury has brought to the table in their third installment. 

The only thing I think I'd wish for in future updates/DLCS is possibly an animal farm hermit vs a field of corn? I'd like different options in preparing for winter. The pikemen are a nice add, but not quite enough depending on what your type of play is.

Also RAW FURY: If you see this review, can you make it that idle builders make snowmen in the winter? Also I hope one day we get a Wizard Unit of some kind. I'd be a big fan of a floppy hat unit throwing fireballs.",True,1544656219

"[b]The [i]Kingdom[/i] series has always had a wonderful charm and minimalism going for it.[/b] While not flawless, the whole experience is quite fun and in my opinion worth the asking price. [i]Kingdom Two Crowns[/i] feels like the definitive edition, or endcap on the series-to-date. It's not completely different or anything, but the new features and of course multiplayer really round out the experience. With that being said, I don't personally care for any further iterations of this series.

Now most people know how this title works, so I want to focus on the flaws I hinted at earlier. First off, all of the [i]Kingdom[/i] installments feel mobile to a fault. In order to keep to a three-button plan, unfortunate sacrifices had to be made. You cannot cancel an order, nor can you de-assign a unit or change a unit to a different profession. Also, you cannot control where units are at or what they are doing. Secondly, there is no stat tracking of how many units you have, or what profession they are assigned to. [i]Do I  have a builder?[/i] Without running all over, who knows. Lastly, the pacing can be quite bad when you are learning. Myself and others have sat for days trying to find some funds, only to have to resort to starting over. Again, these are pickles that you get yourself into that later you can understand how to avoid - but un-fun hours can be wasted.

[b]Pros:[/b]
+Absolutely beautiful postcard-esque pixel art
+The atmosphere just feels great
+The sound effects and music are remarkable
+The campaign mode is fun and compelling
+Multiplayer is a welcome addition and is fun enough (it's literally just an additional player with no added complexity as far as we played)

[b]Cons:[/b]
-While I welcome the latest edition, I think this series has gone just as far as it is going to go
-There was some controversy over if this version was promised to be free; now I don't care and I do think it's worth the money, but some are upset about this
-The extreme minimalism/three-button design severly limits things to a fault
-Can get repetitive of course

"What Went Wrong. (History Lesson.)
2013: The first Kingdom is created and released on NewGrounds.com, much Like Minecraft it is a simple flash/arcade game. This version in my opinion is the best title this Dev team has made, back then i was 10 and i was shocked by the game`s beauty i wanted more as i had gotten so good at the game that i was bored of playing it on my millionth run, and then i opened up the game a month later (Some time had passed while i was playing the game\ among other games) and i see they made a kickstarter! I was overjoyed and quickly asked my mom if i could pay the some money, she said no. And i forgot about it. Some time later i opened up the game again and saw the kickstarter still there, i clicked on it and ""OH MY GOD IT'S CANCELLED!"" 

Jan 14, 2016: I see a Jacksepticeye video in my recommended, i thought he was playing Kingdom the flash game as surely the project was canceled. But low and behold a whole new game! I nearly had a heart attack and begged my mom for it on steam, i opened it up and had nearly as much fun as with the old game. But i saw something that scared my now 13 year old brain, ""This is too much spice..."" i thought as i saw the portals and the knights and as i started getting further then i did with the first game i saw the problem. It was too easy, i ended up getting so meany archers i crashed the game and lost my save. I played some more after this but did not find anything to do, in the flash game it was still dangerous when you had 100 archers and way less lagey. In this one the arrows blotted out the sun and there was no HP scaling to keep the challenge ramping up, just a couple more greed and just as meany arrows.

Aug 9, 2016: This time i saw it on steam, ""The same year?"" i thought. ""Man this has to be simple."" and it was free! I was so happy to see that and looked for a way to pay for the game but could not find one. Any way i loaded up and boom, i was back to taking over the realm with my better PC and fluttering for veins i dominated the game. But what changed? I was disappointed at first but then i looked up a guide and holey moley! there is more places to take over! Boom Boom Boom! And i won? Yes i won in Irl 5 days of around 1-2 hours played 1 per island i won. This saddened me a little but the happiness of at least being able to beat the game made me better till i beat it two times. Then three, and then i was bored with it again.

Dec 19, 2017: Skull island the free DLC came out and i was happy to see it, i booted up my game and low and behold i need to beat the game a forth time in order to get to the ""hard"" island. I beat the game. Wait what? Turns out i had played thru the new island thinking it was island number five as i had not been keeping track and was trying to speed run it! I was so sad and at the time i was just at the age were being sad meant that you were depressed.

Dec 11, 2018: ""Doomsday"" I saw this one on steam as well thinking it was a free DLC and seeing it was full price shocked me as the discount from the bundle was negated by including the OST with the game and at the time i was still unhappy with skull island (Not that i held it, i just started thinking of it when i saw the game.) Well i was not going to buy it, but then my sister asked if we could play it together and i reluctantly got it with some money i had saved up. We tried to play the game three times each one a crash before i got it to start, made a two player non shogun game and had to go to the discussions in order to find out how to activate 2 player on a keyboard witch was not told to you in the game.

After this me and her had some fun (mainly her as the addition of Ninjas/Pike men did not change much.) Well anyway it was all fun and games, i carried her to island 3 and you know what she said? ""This is too easy, i`m bored."" And i could not agree more as seeing greed get blown away by the new mount and watching new recruits air walk was getting old.

Present:March 24, 2019: Nothing major having been done and coming up on a month of radio silence from the devs there is nothing to say but that fixing this Kingdom Two Crowns will not help at this point, the damage was done when they decided to charge full price for a DLC and then not steadily fix all the bugs in said dlc. The 61% score at the time of release says it all, and i hope the devs can recover and release something as simple, beautiful, and as effectively challenging as the flash game they made six years ago.

"Updated as of 18/3/2021
2 years after launch and honestly I'm very disappointed by the amount of glitches it still has. Don't get me wrong, I still love the pixel art and the new expansion and challenge islands but what puts me off the most are the simple glitches.
I'm trying to finish a full run of the Shogun branch and on island 3 my squires stopped going towards the swords I bought. After each restart the swords are gone from the racks and 12 coins for a sword might not seem like much, but know I bought full 4 stacks before each restart only to come back to them all gone.
This bug was only fixed AFTER a full reinstall. I hear this bug can be fixed by going to another island but I was close to winter and was ready to defeat the greed on that island, so this bug cost me precious time.
Now currently I'm on the 4th island. Greed waves are harder at night, my main hall is fully upgraded and so are all my walls. The catapult and the ninja swords on the left side aren't spawning at all, as well as the forge, honestly wtf am I supposed to do now other than a full reset. My mood to play this game is completely killed.


Previous review 12/12/2018
Decided to rewrite the review after playing the game again. I also consider myself somewhat of a Kingdoms veteran having played both the Kingdoms franchise games.
So to start off I’ll point out the advantages of the game-
✔ I’m a fan of pixel art. In this game they added huge amounts of detail into the environment and even to the models. This is a direct upgrade compared to their previous works.
✔ Beautiful music like always. I sometimes listen to their ost and it helps me with my work a lot.
✔ It’s Multiplayer! Although I haven’t tried that out for myself because I have no friends QwQ
✔ With the addition of a new DLC and new NPCs, theres a lot more to explore in this game compared to previous ones.
✔ It’s also harder with the introduction of new currency, new enemies and even adding a new Steel age which makes the Greed in New Lands feel as if they’re barely a threat.
✔ The feature to be able to go back to a Kingdom you reigned over is great, means you can visit your old pals.

However there are also some flaws to the game-
✘ It’s pretty repetitive once you get the gist on how to make things work. For newer players, its very hard to know how to make money and the they start blaming the game AI for not ‘hunting’ properly. – Guide for anyone that’s new – Have an area of grass and let rabbit dens spawn.
✘ Winter is inevitable, in the previous game, winter only comes when you stay too long on an island, this prompts you to move out to a new island. But now you cannot avoid it at all. For veterans like myself, there’s pretty much nothing to do during winter except making the same runs to recruit men and save coins, unable to go on towards the next island because during winter you’d get 0 income, pikemen are able to obtain fish but are available after stone walls are built. New players are very likely to die at this stage.
✘ Being able to go back to previous Kingdoms limits the ability to be able to replay a certain island. In the old game I can choose which island I’d want to go for a 100 or 200 day challenge at but pretty sure you can’t reset the islands unless you start from 0 all over again.
✘ There are still some bugs here and there but most major bugs have been fixed by previous patches.

Overall do I say this game is good? YES
However should you buy this game? Not yet, wait for steam sale if you’re really into it.

"I've never played a Kingdom game before. The game's concept is very clever, and I enjoy the music and art style. However, it suffers from some glaring gameplay issues and a lack of several features that should have been obvious:

-  You frequently get stuck without money and are forced to idle until the day/night cycle, since there's nothing to do. Worse, sometimes your villagers fail to hunt/collect any money, and you have to wait stretches of several days at a time before getting enough money to do what you want. 

- As far as I can tell, there is no way to change the occupations of your villagers, nor to deconstruct archer towers (where archer-type villagers permanently lodge themselves). Furthermore, there is no way to tell a villager what initial occupation to choose. This is extremely annoying as villagers are a limited resource. I found myself stuck without any builders and had to wait for an archer to get attacked by a greedling in order to get one, something that took about 20 minutes (and I'm lucky that he didn't pick a scythe, or a bow from one of the stands instead, or I would've had to repeat the whole process).

- The game suffers from an extreme lack of transparency. Some games do lack of transparency well, forcing the player to figure out their tricks and secrets. This game does not make ""discovering"" it any fun whatsoever. I got to the third island not realizing I needed to unlock stone buildings from the second island. I had to spend about an hour of backtracking (re-building the boat) in order to go back to the second island. The game does not in any way warn you against making extremely tedious, or even savefile-ruining decisions. Maybe to veterans of this series it is obvious that rushing the islands is a foolish mistake, but as a newcomer to this franchise, this was not at all clear to me.

- This is a smaller complaint, but you can't switch mounts without re-buying the original mount. This means that if you want to test out a new mount you just unlocked, and you don't like it, you might have to pay something like 20 gold coins just to swap back to your original mount.

- The pacing is nonsensical. The initial levels are far too easy but take far too long to explore and complete. You get to the point where the enemy invasions can't possibly threaten your base, but you still have to spend something like an hour to clear out the level.

It is unfortunate that such a promising game is bogged down by so many bad design decisions. In its current state, I don't recommend it to anyone but the most patient and forgiving of gamers.",False,1544587308

The art is very nice and amazing to look at. The only downside is that the gameplay and all the units are pretty close to the last one and the learning curve for complete new players is very high imo. With only a VERY LIMITED tutorial, the game does not explain anything else to you.

The pixel art style and music are incredibly beautiful with some nice new effects.

As for the game itself, if you've played the older Kingdom games you will have a basic idea of the gameplay loop. The biggest changes this time around are coop (both local and online) and a campaign style game rather than permadeath. I havent had the chance to try out coop yet myself.

If your a fan of the Kingdom series this should definitely be something you try out at some point, especially if you have a friend to try coop with.",True,1544581977
"Same old charm from the original game, but with more content to explore. Kingdom Two Crowns is absoloutly stunning and a wonderful addition to the series. The new Shogun DLC also breaths some new life into the game. If you're looking for something both relaxing and stimulating, give this game a shot. You can also play it with a friend now! Honestly this game, and it's predecessors, are worth every penny for the amount of time you'll end up putting into them.",True,1544580099

"I played ""New Lands"" for 200 hours, so you know where I'm coming from. I'm just mentioning my thoughts as a veteran of the previous games. I've only played alone so far.

Pros:
- You can upgrade towers 2 more tiers, in both of them the people inside the tower are completely safe, not even attacks from air can get them. This is great!
- Boosters (stronger archers, walls, knights, farmers) only have to be enabled once and then will stay active until you die - they even stay enabled when you go to another island!
- A very cool new way to finally destroy the big portal in the cliff - I won't spoil how, you will love it. It requires a good bit of preparation, which is part of the fun.
- I think people that you recruit in far away villages have an easier time getting to you, because even when they lose their coin, they often make it to you instead of walking back to their village.
- Spear guys can get fish out of water even during winter; so if you take too long you still get an ok income (warning: in the japan setting these don't exist; instead there is another new unit type that doesn't earn money during winter; to compensate that, there are way more trees in Japan to compensate for that, and you can get up to 3 coins for knocking down a tree)
- There are now rotating seasons, so in case of winter you just have to wait. Every season takes 16 days. Winter is from day 48-64
- Putting money into the bank of your castle is now really useful because of the winter season
- You can return to previous islands whenever you built the boat and everything will be more or less as you left it (some walls will be destroyed and people will have lost their weapons though)
- You don't have to bring the boat across the whole map anymore, you just have to build it and then hop in.
- You just have to upgrade the stone upgrade once in the entire game, not on every island; same for the other material upgrade that was added.
- More base and wall upgrades
- Base now expands depending on where is enough room behind your walls and how high the walls are upgraded; the scythe shop will for example now appear outside your base as it used to.
- There is a wall everywhere behind your base; so being inside and outside your base feels really different.
- New mounts (one is pretty cool, the other is rather 'meh')
- If you lose a hermit, you can get it back by returning to that island again and he will be back in his hut
- Knight upgrade giving them twice as much coin storage/armor (5->10)
- One (?) hermit will join your boat the moment you enter it plus the one you have on your horse, so I could bring 2 hermits with me to another island. Not sure if it can even be more.
- If you destroy the portal on the dock, you can build a lighthouse on a rock in the water, which prevents the boat from getting destroyed the next time you go to this island
- Cute new animations

Other changes:
- A lot has been rebalanced. Some things cost a lot more, some run faster some slower. You seem to get much less coins from rabbits, but you can now also get some from fish.
- You have to unlock all sorts of buildings and mounts with gems once before you can use them. It forces you to stratetically switch between islands and go back to previous ones.
- Separate catapult buildings left and right and an additional upgrade
- There are very very few water places to build farms on. You will hardly ever get a proper farm running in the entire game.
- All nights as very easy, it's only a few standard monsters. Only when you destroy a portal it can get dangerous in the following blood moon night
- You can choose an additional japan-setting, which is just a reskin of the game but apart from that it's the same
- If you die/lose the crown you will respawn on island 1 and all upgrades will be disabled - you keep your people and buildings on each island
- New hermits (Spoiler: one upgrades a farm and attracts all mounts that you owned, even across islands - the other one calls all fighters to one side [this one sort of sucks because you cannot be sure anymore that enemies come from the opposite side from the destroyed portal, so you don't know where you have to defend; but if the portals on one side are all destroyed it can be useful])
- Lots of new little things

Contras:
- The art style is done sloppily here. You can now tell it's done in a 3d engine and it's not really 2d. You have pixel objects rotating, so the pixels are not real pixels anymore. Sometimes pixels have different sizes; making the whole style look unpolished and wrong.
- Gems taking up a lot of space in your pocket and it makes it harder to see how many coins you have.
- Still can't see which of your people carry coins
- If you arrive on a new island just as winter starts, you're screwed, because you can't take spear-men with you on the boat. So don't do that! They should seriously fix this by allowing spearmen on boat.
- Spearmen don't pickup coins, so if no one is near them to pick up their coins, they will just vanish at some point
- The knight booster-upgrade still sucks when you are defending, because they will keep dashing through the wall and then get killed
- Can't see how many coins the knights have, you just have to try giving them coins and see if they accept them
- Most of the time I didn't survive destroying the big end portals and wouldn't know how to prevent it; you still win but you have to go through all islands again to reactivate the boosters
- The pocket feels too small in this game, even more than in the previous ones. Because many things will cost 20 coins, even switching a mount costs 14. And if you have gems in your pocket hardly any money fits in. At least some pocket upgrade would have been cool.
- Hermits jumping off when you don't want it to and not jumping off when you want to




Some random thoughts:

It took me 22 hours to get to the end credits.
Two Crowns adds a satisfaction to the game that the previous one could never give me. This is mostly related to the way to finally destroy the big end portal and the big preparation that goes into it.

There is one booster, one mount and one hermit on each island, so to be properly prepared for the 5th and last island you have to go through all previous islands and activate the boosters that you need (archer and walls certainly; the others don't seem important) and you will want to bring a bakery-hermit to the final island.

You can switch back and forth between islands but you have to build the boat everytime to do so. It gets a bit tedious lateron; especially when you are on an island that contains no more enemies at all, it turns into an annoying grind.

It's sad that the farmers are completely irrelevant, or is it? You rely completely on hunting rabbits and fish now. 

I didn't have the experience that the only villages were very far away behind 3 portals on each side - maybe I was lucky, but I was never completely fucked without a bakery as you were in the later levels of ""New lands"". Life with a baker is much easier, but it's also okish without one.

One of the new mounts is pretty cool - you can destroy an entire army of monsters all by yourself with little skill. But it has a terrible stamina!

If you manage to get a stable and have different mounts right in your base, it's pretty cool, so you can easily switch. But for some reason when I built a stable it only attracted the mounts that I owned before. It did not attract the mount that I first got shortly after. I don't know if there is a 3 mount limit or it's a bug. I was surprised to see the mount there that I didn't even bring to that island but had on another island.",True,1544574397
"It gives you everything you expect from a kingdom game therefore it's nice.However, i know i only played 2 hours but it seems way to easy so far.

Edit: It goes hard xd. 
I discovered some game breaking bugs such as hermits dissapears for no reason even doge dissapears :( Also when playing with partner upgraded towers does not work or its completly different towers on our screens.",True,1544569954

fun with friends",True,1544567649
"Loved the 1st and 2nd and i'm already enjoying the 3rd alot 
it has an amazing charm",True,1544566271
its good now,True,1544565928
"While there's been some day 1 bugginess (dropped coins becoming ghosts, jerkiness with my online cohort's sprite animations & sometimes the villagers, coins put into payslots vanishing graphically but still working), overall the four hours I've played this have been EXCEPTIONALLY delightful, and playing with another person and spitting the tasks has made the game less frustrating and more fun. They like babysitting knights on the way to kill portals and I like collecting gold, and so we can cooperate and do the things we love the best!

I haven't tried it as a solo game yet (I've played about one minute without my friend with me), but I absolutely do not regret buying the game twice so we can play together, and look forward to when I can play it again. :D

OTHER THINGS I LIKE:
- The ability to go back to islands you've left, see how they're doing, and upgrading your old kingdom with newly unlocked abilities!
- Ease of getting new mounts; I have a griffin and my friend has a stag and that's beautiful
- The spearmen/pikemen? Their spears break, but they're INCREDIBLY helpful, especially if you have a lot of them and especially moving into winter. Winter has been a breeze, even on island 3!
- EXPLOSIVE BARRELS. watching the greed be set aflame and dying before they reach the walls? spectacular, 1000/10",True,1544564485

"So, I just have one Keyboard. How the hell can i play local Co-op if i dont have a controller? That sucks, it only uses 3 keys and could also use WSAD for player 2... but it doesn't.
Still  a good game, but i bought it for local co-op on Laptop.

if i'm wrong and there's any way to play co-op with a single Keyboard, pls let me know.",True,1544560088
"Love the game but i think we need a second bag or a bigger one just for the gems, or somewhere we can save them.

Edit: YES! Now we have the gems banker.

The only thing we need is more game save slots, just 3 is too low, 5 would be perfect.",True,1544559214
